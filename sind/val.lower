after trying to charge me $ 20 to backcountry camp in rocky mountain national park , i decided to camp for free ( uh ... duh ! ) <eos> in the nearby roosevelt national forest . <eos> approximately 10 miles from estes park , this region does n't have the same high peaks , but the scenery is just as nice . <eos> and at just over 10,500 feet , the temperatures were chily enough at around 20 degrees overnight while camping .

i went to iran for 2 weeks in march . <eos> i visited tehran , isfahan , persepolis , and shiraz . <eos> although i was alone and/or without a camera for much of my trip , i 'm sure there is enough here to bore you . <eos> nowruz - the persian new year - is celebrated in iran beginning on march 21st , with celebrations lasting for weeks . <eos> it is the most significant holiday in iran ( equivalent to christmas in canada ) and has been celebrated in persia in one form or another for almost 3000 years . <eos> it has a profound impact on the people , and therefore would have a profound impact on my trip .

for his birthday this year , tavi decided he wanted to celebrate at his favorite seattle museum , mohai ( museum of history and industry ) . <eos> i was stoked because it 's a genuinely awesome museum , so the kids could run around having fun while the adults sauntered and soaked up seattle historical information . <eos> there were 6 kids and about 15 adults , and i 'm happy to say that no one cried all day , which is pretty much a major accomplishment for a 4 year old 's birthday .

near the 'ben bernake interchange ' , south of the border has been a major eye-sight landmark in south carolina for the many many people that have journeyed down i-95 to the beaches and to florida . <eos> when i was there it was bitter cold and the skies were intensely clear and cloud free . <eos> i would have done more work here , but , my hands were freezing . <eos> this captures only a bit of how strange and surreal it is at south of the border . <eos> its sort of shocking what was appropriate in terms of racial stereotypes at the time this place was constructed . <eos> the owner was a paranoid recluse and throughout the buildings of the compound you can find many hidden passages and secured apartments . <eos> inside one of the shops a pentecostal sermon was being broadcasted . <eos> i asked the woman sipping a coffee from a styrofoam cup working at one of the registers , what exactly was playing and she told me that the shop manager put it on the radio when the staff could n't be in church , and believe her ( the girl with the coffee , wearing a home star runner sweatshirt ) she did not want to be there . <eos> believe me , i wanted to spirit her to washington ! <eos> an interesting note -- ben bernake worked here ! ! <eos> !

bike drag races on open roads in oakland , pa. also skid & amp ; track stand competitions . <eos> unfortunately , i do n't have many pictures of the races themselves . <eos> i did n't start shooting until my heats were done . <eos> apologies also for the graininess & amp ; bluriness ; not wanting to blind cyclist sprinting through cars at 30 mph , i skipped the flash . <eos> we were racing 3 man heats . <eos> i finished inches behind nathan in the first heat to advance to the wildcard round where was second by a few bike lengths to zak and was out . <eos> better luck next time i guess .

june 15 , 2006- nonsense news service - andrea luey the second barbie bike olympic games was held on june 12 , 2006 at the university of victoria . <eos> these games featured two time trials ( the short track , and the challenging grass/pavement course ) , as well as an exhibition event in the fountain . <eos> the defending champion , andrea luey was back in action . <eos> absent from the competition was past silver medalist tony geluch , who was apparently working for the man in vancouver . <eos> his presence was sorely missed , but his spirit was not forgotten . <eos> despite this gap , the addition as a competitor of the official bbo photographer , melinda , as well as mr barbie bike himself , robert shirkey set the stage for what many spectators thought would be a tight three-way race . <eos> the end results , however , showed mr. shirkey with a clear win over luey and skeels . <eos> despite the obvious disadvantage of being the only competitor wearing flip-flops , as well as a very ill-timed laugh-attack that literally took her breath away , luey 's effort and passion reminded many in the audience what this competition is all about . <eos> unfortunately , her passion was not enough to post strong results . <eos> skeels , still recovering from a recent bb accident in which she broke both a rib and her laptop , displayed grit and determination that would make everyone in the bb co-op proud . <eos> not surprisingly , her injury impeded her success and her times were simply not up to par . <eos> however , skeels ' performance will be remembered as feisty and inspiring , proving that a broken rib does not mean a broken spirit . <eos> meanwhile , shirkey put in nearly flawless performances which placed him comfortably at the top of the standings in both events . <eos> his comfort and familiarity with the bb ( despite its recent tune-up ) were obvious advtanages for him , which he combined with a strong degree of preparation and focus to easily win the competition . <eos> despite having very important things to do after the games , the competitors were available for quick comment . <eos> both luey and shirkey confirmed that they will now call toronto home and thus will not be around the bb for some time . <eos> skeels added that she is the present caretaker of the bb and will treat it with the high level respect that it is due , as well as ensure that others do the same . <eos> luey dreamily mentioned that she hopes to find a sister bb in toronto so that the values that the bb represents -- community , sharing and foolishness -- can grow stronger in a city where people sometimes take themselves a little too seriously . <eos> before rushing off to other shennanigans , luey stated quite simply : & quot ; the world needs more barbie bikes. & quot ;

we went to < a href= '' http : //chifarestaurant.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > chifa restaurant < /a > on 02/27 for erin 's birthday dinner ! <eos> noms ! <eos> featuring the work of iron chef garces . <eos> we got the & quot ; chef 's tasting & quot ; , which was something like 8 different dishes selected by the chef ( as in , we had no idea what we would get ) , served tapas style , each with enough for all 7 of us to get a taste . <eos> most of the dishes are n't represented here , though , because people could n't keep their grubby paws off of it long enough for me to take pictures . <eos> the final bill , including our adult beverages , was incredible , but so was the food and the experience ! <eos> we were going to head over to eulogy afterwards for drinks , but the manager offered to buy us a drink at the bar to get us to leave the table ( & quot ; you 're not overstaying your welcome , it 's just that a party of < em > old people < /em > showed up an hour before their reservation. & quot ; ) , and after that we were all ready to call it a night .

these are shots from a short outing tonight ( mon apr 02 , 2007 ) with my friend , mark . <eos> we drove south of town to some sandstone rock outcropings that i 've driven by on the interstate for over 30 years without stopping . <eos> they look amazing from the road , and up close they are carved or painted everywhere with names , cities , etc . <eos> recently vandals are using paint . <eos> there are layers of broken bottles from parties held here , and if there are stories to tell , they are not good ones . <eos> the windmills are on a parallel road about 5 miles east of the rock outcroppings and were really fun to shoot ... all are test shots so i 'll be revisiting them throughout the summer , both at sunrise and sunset for dramatic light .

summer , 2012. walkways and guard rails at desert view point are currently being refurbished by grand canyon 's trail crew . <eos> the goal is to make the area more aesthetically pleasing , and to bring footpaths up to current ada standards . <eos> at any given time , the crew is made up of of 3-5 employees . <eos> work on the project began off site . <eos> mason ross marshall and his crew built a & quot ; mockup & quot ; of a stone planter that would ultimately be installed just southeast of desert view watchtower . <eos> the planter was then broken down and transported to desert view , where it was reassembled in place . <eos> trail crew is also working to refurbish liner stone around existing walkways and viewpoints , raise the current level of hand/guard rails by 6 inches ; then repave the entire area around the watchtower and desert view overlook . <eos> construction is expected to continue through the end of july , 2012. nps photos by kristen m caldon .

the last few days of december , as well as new year 's weekend , have been bitter-cold in new york city ( and many other parts of the country , as i 've been able to see on tv ) . <eos> consequently , people bundle up and cover themselves from head to toe with coats , hats , scarves , mufflers , gloves , leggings , and anything else they can think of . <eos> it does n't leave much exposed , from a photographic perspective . <eos> also , it 's a lot harder to take any photographs , when you 're shivering from the cold and being buffeted by the wind ... nevertheless , i decided to venture out into the cold during my lunch break a couple times last week , to see what might be worthy of a quick photo . <eos> i had my gloves on , so there was no opportunity for fine-tuned adjustments to my camera ; basically , all i could do was focus and shoot ... all i could think of , as i took these photos was : all of this will look much more interesting in the summer ! <eos> p.s . <eos> these photos were all taken on the corner of broadway & amp ; 96th , and also broadway & amp ; 97th street , in the neighborhood where i live ...

these pictures show the normal level of maintenance the dcr affords the stairs and walkways of the famous longfellow bridge between cambridge and boston after a typical massachusetts snow event of a few inches . <eos> the footprints of the many pedestrians who depend on the bridge show that it receives a lot of foot traffic , even in bad weather . <eos> pedestrians headed towards boston face the choice of walking on the ice into the lane of oncoming traffic , or navigating down the icy granite steps and taking a & quot ; make your own & quot ; path through the snow towards charles circle . <eos> again , the footprints reveal how many people depend on this critical route . <eos> someone from the dcr did run a plow down the length of the main walkway across the bridge , but they left the edges under the iron railings with an accumulation which , via a few freeze-thaw cycles , helps to break up the concrete at the edge of the bridge that the railings are mounted on , and is contributing to their tilting outward towards the river .

a record of the backpacker 's club meet 13th.- 15th . <eos> april 20121. our leader : gaz holt , we meet at snake inn and move to edale for the second of our two nights out . <eos> on saturday we logged about 14 good upland derbyshire miles with approximately another eight on sunday .
several long sections of sr 104 near lake forest park received an asphalt overlay in areas where the pavement was deteriorating . <eos> traffic and repeated freeze and thaw cycles during the seattle winters were taking their toll on the road . <eos> wsdot maintenance crews went to work during the week of july 16 , preparing the pavement and carefully spreading the new asphalt . <eos> an overlay like this should last many years but it 's still a bandaid that will only hold the road together for so long .

spescom software , inc. halloween party 2005
let 's start by saying that this was the oddest venue i 've ever seen a show at -- it was basically a sheet metal garage with concrete floors and huge brewing vats all over . <eos> about a hundred people allowed in , although the garage door ( ! ) <eos> was opened after the first song so the people outside could get to hear the show . <eos> this was the eleventh time we 've seen the band this year , and frankly , it does n't get better than this . <eos> taking everything in stride , the band played a show that was incredible . <eos> and not one taper there . <eos> a decade from now , people will mention this show with reverence . <eos> it was that special . <eos> set 1 : cold water old dangerfield chains stillwater getaway mourning flies the cuckoo bird elko little rabbit was on the setlist to close the set , but they did n't play it until the encore . <eos> set 2 : long way to go bird in a house like a buddha crossing the gap black bear ( not on the setlist , but grubb started playing it anyway ) waterfountain quicksand i am a mess * do the dog * storms encore : little rabbit * brady rymer , bass player of from good homes on electric bass monster show . <eos> set 1 was great , and clocked in around 50 minutes . <eos> set 2 , however , was around 100 minutes or so . <eos> buddha was great as always , and i really liked the new tim song , crossing the gap . <eos> then grubb just started the bass line for black bear and the magic really began . <eos> i love this song and this was as good as i 've heard them play , either in person or on tape . <eos> wfqs was incredible , and then brady came up onstage ( we saw him at set break ) and the band launched into the absolute best i am a mess that i 've ever heard . <eos> todd 's solo was incredible and timmy played on top of it at the end -- mind blowing . <eos> then out came do the dog , another old fgh song that had the place roaring . <eos> a gorgeous storms ended the set and the little rabbit encore was huge . <eos> timmy started it at the speed of the second round , and they played it out five times instead of the normal four . <eos> i 've never heard them play faster or tighter . <eos> for me , there is n't a better band out there than what we saw and heard tonight . <eos> edit : 12.21.09 : heh , dorky review .

torino ( turin ) is a town in the northern italy from which on a good day you can see the alps . <eos> unfortunately it was a bit hazy the whole time we where there , but we got an outline of the great moutains in the distance , for a moment . <eos> at the end we did have an amazing view of them from the plane . <eos> torino is also known as the hometown of the juventus football club , the birthplace of solid chocolate , the location of the infamous shroud of turin , and the hometown of the international companies lavazza and fiat . <eos> turin has hosted many events including the 2006 winter olympics as well as a yearly chocolate festival . <eos> the original solid chocolates , created by a man called gianduja , were a mixture of cocoa and the much cheaper hazelnut resulting in one of the best combinations of flavours , ever . <eos> although we did n't have the chance to try the gianduja chocolates while in turin ( they were unreasonably priced at the airport ) , i did have a taste of the gianduja gelato , which was heavenly . <eos> like a creamy , cold , soft nutella .

gallier hall is a historic building on st. charles avenue in new orleans , louisiana . <eos> it is the former new orleans city hall . <eos> it is currently a convention center , reception hall , and home of the ty tracy theatre , named for the late artistic director who ran the new orleans recreational department theatre . <eos> today , the ty tracy theatre is home to julie condy 's crescent city lights youth theatre . <eos> gallier hall is located on st. charles avenue at lafeyette square in the central business district . <eos> the building was originally designed to be the city hall of new orleans by the noted architect , james gallier , sr .. construction began in 1845 , and the building was dedicated on 10 may 1853. gallier hall is a three-story marble structure fronted by two rows of fluted ionic columns in the neoclassical style . <eos> it is one of the most important structures built during the ante-bellum period of the city . <eos> after its dedication in 1853 , gallier hall remained the city hall for just over a century . <eos> many important events during the civil war , reconstruction , and the era of louisiana governor huey long took place at gallier hall . <eos> today , it is best known as a place of honor during mardi gras . <eos> viewing galleries in front of the hall are reserved for mardi gras royalty , and parades on the st. charles route pause in front them . <eos> marching bands typically perform shows here during the parades .

i had the chance to check out the carnevale in venice in february 2010 - what a blast - this is always an incredible experience . <eos> on the first sunday of the carnevale there is a grand parade in the piazza di san marco . <eos> it is definitely crowded and not easy to shot in with people elbowing each other out of the way - true italian chaos ! <eos> these are n't my best shots of the carnevale but they fall into the & quot ; not bad & quot ; category .

this was v 's first trip to the disneyland resort in anaheim . <eos> we visited california adventure the first day and disneyland the second day . <eos> not pictured are our wanderings through downtown disney or the grand californian ( where we stayed ) . <eos> visiting the park with an infant gave me a whole new perspective . <eos> it was unlike any disney trip i had taken before -- in many good ways and a few bad ways as well . <eos> i 'm looking forward to when v is older and she ( and we ) can enjoy more of what disneyland has to offer .
i did not eat one bit of corn .
kind of spur of the moment , jesse and vail decided to throw a bit of an art party . <eos> those of us who made it had the chance to putter around with acrylic paints on some very different canvases . <eos> the next day , some of us hit up the arlington fair . <eos> the pics here are all straight from whatever camera took them -- or the app that used the camera . <eos> any special effects were done in-camera , so , technically , everything is still , as usual , straight from the camera .

kim kardashian and khloe get david jones tills ringing , chaos american reality television celebrity kim kardashian was once again the cause of a mass of humanity ( and massive traffic jams in the sydney cbd ) , described by many as complete & quot ; chaos & quot ; . <eos> coincidence or not , emergency vehicle sirens could be heard roaring through sydney 's cbd district , with car accidents and fan barricades at bursting point , all while mother nature delivered a torrential downpour of rain . <eos> inside david jones sirens of a different kind - media and fan heat seekers kim kardashian and sister khloe promoted their wares - new handbags dubbed the kardashian kollection . <eos> the bags kept cash tills ringing , although a purchase of a handbag did not 100 % guarantee an autograph or photo . <eos> the massive queue to see the celebs went from inside the department store on castlereagh street and around many city blocks , with teeny poppers forming the most part of of the crowd . <eos> & quot ; i love the kardashians & quot ; said tori rudolph , 13 , who skipped school . <eos> the influenced teen had been been waiting in the city since 10pm on wednesday night - well past bed time . <eos> five other school friends had joined her . <eos> kim , 31 , was fresh off a divorce filing from nba player kris humphries on monday , citing & quot ; irreconcilable differences. & quot ; police officers in yellow vests and numerous security guards patrolled the outside of the popular store as the dynamic duo promoted their wares to a captive audience . <eos> kardashian - continuing to put the business in show business , be it hollywood or australia . <eos> websites keeping up with the kardashian's au.eonline.com/on/shows/kardashians/index.html kim kardashian official web blog < a href= '' http : //www.kimkardashian.celebuzz.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.kimkardashian.celebuzz.com < /a > david jones < a href= '' http : //www.davidjones.com.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.davidjones.com.au < /a > eva rinaldi photography flickr < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography '' > www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography < /a > eva rinaldi photography < a href= '' http : //www.evarinaldi.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.evarinaldi.com < /a >

nobody can be quite certain of the date of aldenham ’ s first church . <eos> however the presence of large quantities of hertfordshire puddingstone in the present building may indicate that it rests on the site of some kind of pre-christian worship . <eos> christopher webbe ’ s wonderfully designed east window includes a panel showing the 8th century king offa holding a saxon church , and an 11th century norman window , probably from an earlier building , can be seen at the west end of our south aisle . <eos> the earliest available document to mention the present church relates to the appointment of a vicar and is dated 1267 , so it would seem fair to assess the origins of this building as the mid-13th century . <eos> the lower part of the tower , the font and a large part of the lady chapel date from this period , while the south and north aisles date from the 14th and 15th centuries respectively . <eos> to the 15th century too belong the wonderfully decorated oak ceiling in the nave , the painted oak lady chapel screen and the upper tower , diagonal buttresses and stair turret . <eos> in the 16th century the chancel was widened and a vestry added . <eos> these additions and improvements seem to have been made without regard to the overall symmetry of the building , which remains quaintly asymmetrical to this day . <eos> various 19th century renovations culminated in a major overhaul and improvement project in 1882 , instigated by the merchant banker and part-compiler of the first oxford dictionary , henry hucks gibbs . <eos> this included complete reseating of the nave in oak , supplying a new organ and removing and replacing many years of decayed plaster , under which some early features of the church were discovered , including a rood passage , an original painted screen and the original priest 's door into the sanctuary . <eos> in 1940 several bombs fell in the churchyard , damaging the spire and tower and several windows . <eos> the damage could not be made good until 1946. the building is a grade 1 listed building
st etheldreda is hatfield 's parish church . <eos> this building , although steeped in england 's history , is not a museum . <eos> it is a meeting place for a thriving christian community . <eos> the congregation on a sunday ranges from babes in arms to grandparents . <eos> their link with st etheldreda , a saxon princess , is through the bishops of ely , who owned the manor of hatfield from about 930 until 1538. the present church dates from the 13th century , although little remains of the mediaeval building . <eos> during the 15th century the tower was constructed by cardinal morton and later the brocket chapel was added . <eos> the salisbury chapel was built during the 17th century ; shortly after the completion of hatfield house , which stands nearby . <eos> finally during the 19th century there was major reconstruction of the nave and roof , necessitated by the poor state of the fabric . <eos> the tower was restored 20 years ago . <eos> when i visited the church the rector had the builders in . <eos> the pews were out and the nave was being scaffolded so i did n't manage to record all the windows . <eos> it was very dusty and movement was limited . <eos> i may revisit when the work is completed at easter . <eos> the church dates back over 900 years and is attached to hatfield house seat of the earl of salisbury .

nos fuimos de san luis con la firme intención de regresar , quedarnos más tiempo con javier y sara que nos recibieron brazos y corazones abiertos , conocer el desierto ... la estancia en monterrey fue emocionante . <eos> llevábamos un ao con esta fantasía de conocer el tec de monterrey porque es de las pocas plantas de biodiesel en méxico , y traen unos proyectos de investigación sobre biodiesel de segunda generación ( a partir de jatropha curcas ) re-chingones . <eos> y bueno , la realidad de estos universitarios arrastró con lo que habíamos previsto . <eos> nos metimos en un bullicio de investigaciones geniales , unos pirotécnicos intelectuales que nos dieron viento en popa , además de ser unos tipazos ( y tipaza ) . <eos> el campus del tec es el lugar más insólito y más adecuado para la locura universitaria : hay plantas de jatropha en el jardín , pavos reales , venados , y unos laboratorios que por fin me parecen congruentes : pocas máquinas , muchos papeles , mucha discusión , semillas , manchas de aceite , y miradas chispeantes . <eos> misma efervescencia en la udem , donde inventaron el tope inteligente que merece el interés de la comunidad internacional . <eos> pasamos del bullicio al lugar más improbable del país , estación catorce , un oasis con tren y gato , donde me prometí regresar a acabar tareas pendientes ... el ekeko sigue firme , abriendo caminos inesperados ... mail @ laboratorioenmovimiento.com

easter sunday with sheri smith < b > these photos were originally posted on my website , with the following text ... < /b > < i > < b > originally posted : < /b > april 2002 < b > sheri smith ! < /b > my bestest girlfriend & amp ; deeply heartfelt co-life explorer , sheri anna-leah smith ! <eos> < b > relationship rip : < /b > march 1 , 2002 - july 28 , 2002 i had the pleasure of dating sheri smith for a number of months in 2002 , and i will never forget the time i spent with her . <eos> there will always be a huge place in my heart for sheri , and a part of her will always be with me . <eos> photosets 1 through 5 make references that sound as if me and sheri are still dating simply because they were posted while we were dating . <eos> i 've essentially left them as i originally posted them because they do reflect a moment in time when we were dating and i cherish the fact that they document those times and how we felt . <eos> but even though our romantic relationship came to an end , i 'm very glad to say that we are still good friends . <eos> as such , the more recent photosets document that continuing friendship . <eos> in short , i will always be there for sheri , no matter what . <eos> - steve = ) < /i >
