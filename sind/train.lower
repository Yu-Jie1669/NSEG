crater lake national park is one of those mystical places that seem to exist only in the imagination of willful writers . <eos> however , this place is real and nestled in the snow covered mountain ranges in southern oregon , a mere 450 mile journey from the bay area . <eos> the first view of it when you crest over the last hill and stand behind the concrete railing is one of a immense rich blue body of water surrounded by snow-capped peaks . <eos> the water , so blue and the sky , so clear make for a matching pair . <eos> the surrounding hills and the vast snowfields are a joy to behold , especially in the middle of summer . <eos> i have never seen this much snow ever . <eos> worth a second visit . <eos> but not worth a 2 day stay , because the view doesnt change .
we had a little gathering at our humble apartment .
bbq at andy and opie 's .

these were taken at the si folklife in june '05 . <eos> the major themes at this year 's fest were oman ( life in desert , oasis and sea ) , food culture usa ( influences on american food in the last 40 years , sustainable agriculture , healthy eating and nutrition ) and forestry ( it 's been 100 years since the forestry services was established ) . <eos> i expected to be most pleased with the food culture part of the fest , but the people , the stories and the colours of the oman part were just too irresistable .
07.04.03 mike suggested we go to queen 's west to watching the fireworks this year . <eos> it 's a great idea , the piers that go out into the water have the best views with manhattan as a backdrop .

an asado , or barbecue , is probably one of the most argentine of traditions . <eos> people will grill up mountains of meat to celebrate any special occasion . <eos> back in september mariana invited us to her family 's house in quilmes , a town outside of ba , for her birthday asado .

hello , stephen from page 45 here . <eos> page 45 is the comic shop in nottingham which marcus refers to as his dealer ( such is the man 's addiction ) , and i 've been asked to provide a guest commentary on this unfortunate record of our celebrations ( such is marcus ' recklessness ) . <eos> we said we 'd buy our customers a drink or two to thank them for supporting us . <eos> and they turned up , so that 's us out of pocket . <eos> now , click on the top-left photo . <eos> go on , we wo n't bite .

on a sunny thursday , the day i 've been waiting for for seemingly forever arrived - hooding ! ! <eos> the ceremony is just for the doctoral recipients , so there 's no worry about having enough tickets and what-not - it 's open to everyone and has a nice casual feel to it . <eos> and you get a hood . <eos> : )
went camping for stephanie 's birthday ... a few of the shots from the trip i liked ...
em 's summary : history museum , i do believe in ferries , actual shed , tim horton 's for lunch , exploration of parks near old montreal , dinner at excellent chinese place in latin quarter .
in an extremely generous and incredibly sound move , jingjing took a day off work to show us around beijing and see all the sights . <eos> the first place she took us to see was jingshan park , overlooking the forbidden city . <eos> this is located on jingshan hill , however it 's not actually a real hill . <eos> when they were making the forbidden palace , they used all the earth dug up when making the moat to create an artificial hill as previous imperial palaces had been situated to the south of a hill , and apparently there was better feng shiu because of this . <eos> while there , we also got to see glenn test his hackeysack skills against some old chinese people ... sadly it was no contest . <eos> the old guys won effortlessly ...
& quot ; back when we was kids , we went to san fermin 2 years running ... literally running for our lives ! & quot ; this is what passes for a photo record of the second of these trips . <eos> i 'm not entirely sure all of these photos are from the same year .

the clubbing continued as we made our way across the island to the next of the super clubs , pacha . <eos> the night definitely did n't go all pete tong , as a good night was had by all , as we wandered round the club , famous from any number of movies shot in ibiza , and checked out the different rooms . <eos> having liquored ourselves up beforehand , we were left free to appreciate the music and like the hardcore clubbers that we are , we did n't leave until they kicked us out ...
this was my high school dance team , which is called & quot ; poms & quot ; in the midwest . <eos> all pictures were taken my senior year of high school ( 2004 ) , ages 17-18 .
taking advantage of the chinese new year holidays in malaysia , we decided to do something different and drove to krabi . <eos> it took us 5 hours to get there from the border and having a guy with gps in our group helped a lot . <eos> it was good holiday albeit a bit short . <eos> would n't mind going there again .

12 of 12 for august
i was lucky to be invited on a field trip from aspen to independence pass with author paul andersen , photographer david hiser and geologist bruce bryant . <eos> bruce mapped aspen area geology in the 60 's for the usgs and as a result , some amazing maps were created and an out-of-print sought-after booklet title he geologic story of aspen . <eos> amazing to be out with him . <eos> he did his field research in 16 or 17 months between 1963 and 1968. he has trammeled the aspen backcountry as deeply as anyone and is an amazing guy . <eos> my other field trippers are pretty awesome as well .
as usual , we went to ocean park for bday as it 's free of charge . <eos> toppy invited her parent-in-laws

bjrn invited us over to his house , an old prison , to have dinner . <eos> and serve time and food .
just a few photos from my house 's 4th annual pre-thanksgiving potluck , which this year also served as a dual birthday party . <eos> i was playing with my sb-800 in commander mode with an sb-600 turning the ceiling of our dining room into a giant softbox . <eos> not too much success but i salvaged a few usable images .
now for the worst part of traveling : the trip back home .
let us never speak of this again .

when given the opportunity to go to japan , you definitely do not say & quot ; no & quot ; . <eos> i certainly did not ! <eos> i traveled to japan for 12 days along with friends and family to the cities of tokyo , nikko , kyoto , and hakone . <eos> i fell in love with japan while i was there , and can not wait to visit again .

kids and pup playing in the back yard !
day trip to yilan country , about an hour or two outside of taipei , including : wufengchi waterfalls , cold springs at suao , and a seafood dinner at nangfang-ao .
hot , humid , hilly , 1000 registered , approx . <eos> 600 finished .
another great race to remember . <eos> although i finished in last place , i had a really fun time defending against the car behind while trying to pass the car in front . <eos> i tried more than i 've tried before and kept closer than i 'd dared before and in the end after 10 laps , i was a little impatient and tried looking up the outside on the first hairpin where i spun out . <eos> as i spun out i remember chuckling to myself as it rang home how silly a move that was . <eos> i was 12th at the time . <eos> i do n't regret the move though . <eos> you ca n't improve if you do n't try new things or experiment . <eos> i 'm happy i tried : - )
met lydia 's friend rachel and her family at the zoo for a short spell before taking them back to their hotel . <eos> lydia had dropped them off earlier in the morning . <eos> title and descriptions coming & quot ; soon & quot ; .
our drive through the highlands and our day by loch ness
just a few pics i took when i gave my daughter samantha and her boyfriend wyman back to sharps corner after a weekend visit .
october 11 was a memorable day for me . <eos> the demonstration was a thrilling show of the diversity and decency of gay people in this country . <eos> it was also memorable because after i left the demonstration , i was stricken with a near-fatal heart attack . <eos> i 'm thankful still to be here .
every year the zoo has a halloween walk where small children can get candy . <eos> we met up with our friends and survived the crowds this year .

this relatively new bike trail utilizes the right-of-way of two abandoned railroads . <eos> from joliet to manhattan , the trail is on an ex-milwakee road alignment ( abandoned in the 1980s ) and from manhattan to kankakee [ and through symerton ] the trail uses an ex-wabash/n & amp ; w/norfolk southern right-of-way ( abandoned circa 1990 ) . <eos> this set was shot with a canon p & amp ; s , not my usual pentax dslr .
a small sampling of dad 's beautiful pictures from burma .
rose , jamie , my father col and i went camping for a couple of nights at a place called the deua river , about 90 minutes from canberra .
in 1979 i spent a year at st. christopher 's school in penang , malaysia . <eos> on march 19 we decided to drop in on the school to see what it 's like today . <eos> we were warmly received by the current principal , a transplanted welshman named john jones who 's going on his 20th year at the school . <eos> he brought us on a tour and it confirmed for me what a fantastic school it was and continues to be . <eos> it has remained in the same location and though it has expanded ( it now has close to 600 kids from nursery through 6 ) it has n't lost its sense of warmth , coziness , and fun . <eos> i revisited a whole host of fond memories as i walked through the halls and classrooms .

the second state the get out more tour visited in 2010 was new jersey . <eos> we had presentation events at campmor in paramus , and blue ridge mountain sports in princeton . <eos> while visiting new jersey we searched out the pinelands and spent some time on the batona and batsto trails exploring the history and environments of wharton state park . <eos> our new jersey adventures prove that no matter where you live there is somewhere you can escape to if you are in search of the peace and quiet of the wilderness .
spent the weekend in new jersey for the pohlman wedding . <eos> on sunday before the flight out , we had time to check out central park ( my first time , niki 's 18th )
apparently this state beach is closed to the public ... none of the 20-30 carloads of people seemed to be aware of that .
on may 9th , joan , mark , emily , and i took a pleasant sunday afternoon walk . <eos> we started at the new south gate of the city , near the central campus , and walked around the wall to the old south gate . <eos> from there we walked through town to the east campus .
each year , our local homebrewing club , < a href= '' http : //www.starcitybrewers.org '' rel= '' nofollow '' > star city brewers guild < /a > , puts on a homebrewing demonstration in november as part of aha 's awkwardly named teach a friend to homebrew day ( changing this year to the more succinct , yet more generic , & quot ; < a href= '' http : //www.homebrewersassociation.org/pages/events/learn-to-homebrew-day '' rel= '' nofollow '' > learn to homebrew day < /a > & quot ; . <eos> we decided that it would be fun to do it in the lovely weather in early may . <eos> we set up in the parking lot outside of our local homebrew supply store , < a href= '' http : //www.blueridgehydroponics.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > blue ridge hydroponics & amp ; home brewing < /a > . <eos> the temperatures were n't too bad , but the constant threat ( and realization ) of the ( recently regular ) thunderstorms cast a cloud over the gathering . <eos> ( and probably reduced the potential homebrewers that might 've otherwise visited ... ) but , weather aside , we enjoyed ourselves demonstrating the process , sharing samples of homebrew and regaling our guests with experiences and ruminations on the subject ... note : i had my camera set up for overexposed pictures indoors ( taking pictures of beer bottles ) and forgot about it . <eos> as such the pictures in this series are crap . <eos> i did what i could with adobe photoshop elements , but ...

i and those in earlier waves definitely had an advantage in the duathlon this morning . <eos> for me in wave 2 it was dry on the 1st 2 mile run and had dry roads on the bike course to about mile 9 and then the rain came and conditions rapidly deteriated from then on as rain and winds picked up with thunderstorms moving in . <eos> it was tough on gg and a with the rain and winds picking up , but i pedaled as ... fast as i could to beat the storm . <eos> when i got back to transition , my running shoes were soaked , so i took my wet bike shoes and soggy socks off and slipped into my wet running shoes barefoot . <eos> my waves bike racks were on the paved walking path , so that was really nice . <eos> everyone else 's bike was in the wet , soggy , and muddy grass . <eos> i did really great . <eos> i fiinished 5th in my age division and was just a couple minutes behind from receiving an award in my age division . <eos> my 2nd run was 2 minutes longer than the 1st run , so i got to work on keeping my endurance and pace up in the 2nd run and also need to shave some seconds off in my transition time and also win the new $ 3,200 bike this summer in the national bike challlenge and put aero bars on it lol and then next year i will win an award . <eos> : ) i did very well this year and my total time for the whole duathlon was only 1:26.34.3. and placed 71 overall . <eos> i just beat another neenah guy by 11 seconds who finished 72. i did cross the finish line before 9 am , but the rain came early . <eos> : ( i am very worried about my dentist , brandon roth . <eos> he was not on the sheet for the first 175 finishers and i did n't see him get back and he usually does very well . <eos> he was in a later wave and some guys said someone wiped out on the bike course and was hauled away in an ambulance . <eos> i hope it was not him . <eos> the bike accident caused a delay for some riders and some riders also got caught by a train on gg . <eos> after i finished the race , the weather really got nasty with bad thundersrtorms , lightning , wind , and heavy downpours . <eos> there is a flood warning for the fox river and more rain is on the way for tomorrow and tuesday before it dries out on wednesday .
we had fun in the garden then played with the bsers .
went to see this on the way to the canyons .
here are 8 week old pure bred akc registerd beagle puppies . <eos> they are very cute and we have tri color and chocolate .

across northern illinois - 10/17/12 i got a note the other day from paul enenbach , an engineer friend of mine from wisconsin that he and his friend richard from canada would be in town today , and how ’ d you like to get together for a little fanning ? <eos> fine with me , but apparently not with the forecasters who predicted clouds and rain , a good day for ducks perhaps , but not for fanning . <eos> still were weren ’ t going to let a little weather stand in our way , so plans were made to meet and greet at their hotel on tuesday morning and then hit the road to check out the damp rail scene west of chicago .

07.14.04 i love coney island , i love rawkin ' out , so i really love the siren music festival . <eos> this was was the 4th one they 've had , the 4th one we 've been to .
this is the first time i tried to photograph fireworks with a tripod . <eos> these were shot in blooming prairie , mn . <eos> the rain earlier in the day meant not a lot of people were there , and we had almost-too-good seating- we were so close that it was hard to get bursts in the frame . <eos> these are all as shot out of the camera ( thus the often poor centering ) but gives an idea of how varied the locations and the closeness of some of the bursts , since i never changed position .

after the disappointment of there being no fireworks we made the best of our spare time to wander up the embankment towards parliament . <eos> on the way we enjoyed the usual stunning views of the london eye lit up across the river . <eos> what was more unusual was the huge advertisement being projected on the shell building behind it . <eos> it was for diabetes awareness , which is an important cause , but was projecting a 15 floor high picture of a man peeing really the best way to get that across ? ! <eos> after snapping beautiful and amusing photos we slipped up past the mod to whitehall , taking a chance to get the obligatory photo with a guard at horse guards , then on to try and get a glimpse of 10 downing street . <eos> the cenotaph was an impressive sight as we were there just after remembrance day and many of the poppy wreaths left by the public and the royal family and government representatives were still arranged around the monument ( albeit a little wind battered ) . <eos> with the harsh conditions and dramatic lighting it really was quite a moving sight and hopefully one i 've captured well in pictures . <eos> finally we headed across westminster bridge and then onto the south bank for our ride on the london eye !

trip to xochimilco ( cd . <eos> mexico , mexico ) . <eos> dec. 2010. xochimilco is one of the sixteen delegaciones or boroughs within mexican federal district . <eos> it is located within mexico city , 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) south of the city center . <eos> [ 1 ] to the north it has borders with coyoacán , tlalpan and iztapalapa ; to the west with tláhuac ; and to the southeast with milpa alta . <eos> it covers an area of 122 km2 ; it is the third biggest delegación . <eos> xochimilco is better known for its extended series of canals ― all that remain of the ancient lake xochimilco . <eos> xochimilco has kept its ancient traditions , even though its proximity to mexico city influences that area to urbanize . <eos> movies such as maría candelaria ( 1940 ) have given that area a romantic reputation where all inhabitants travel in colorful trajineras ( xochimilco boats ) between chinampas covered with flowers . <eos> today , agriculture is an important but minor activity ; the canals represent only a small fraction of their former extent , chinampería ( chinampa-related activities ) . <eos> it was declared a world heritage site by unesco in 1987 . <eos> [ 1 ] the name xochimilco comes from nahuatl , and means & quot ; some place with flowers & quot ; . <eos> it is pronounced [ otimiko ] in nahuatl and [ sotimilko ] in spanish . <eos> [ wikipedia 2010 ]

although members of our coffee department may travel more frequently than many other coffee buyers , we still usually make our trips around the same time as everyone else , and it 's not uncommon to run into representatives from other roasting companies while visiting a cooperative or eating in a favorite small-town restaurant . <eos> as i planned my most recent trip to peru C on the opposite side of the year from harvest and in the middle of the rainy season , no less C i suspected that i 'd have the cenfrocafe cooperative and the whole coffee scene of san ignacio all to myself . <eos> so , why would one want to visit a coffee farm on the opposite side of the year from the harvest and in the middle of the rainy season ? <eos> i asked myself that very question ( with some irritation ) each time i lost one of the knee-high rubber wading boots ( borrowed from teófilo ojeda ) to the endless mud of farm foot paths . <eos> but each of the conversations we conducted with growers C once we finally arrived at a destination C renewed my excitement to be working on an unusual project for a coffee buyer : exploring the impact of a micro lot .

duck key history : the key was the site of a salt manufacturing operation in the 1820s & amp ; 1830s . <eos> occupation of the island ceased after the labor day hurricane of 1935 and did not resume until the key was connected to the highway by a causeway in 1953. j.w . <eos> norie , in his piloting directions for the gulf of florida , the bahama bank & amp ; islands ( 1828 ) states : & quot ; duck key - some two miles ( 3 km ) long , low , rocky , & amp ; covered with mangroves ; some small patches of good land with a little timber . <eos> this island formerly saltworks but they were transferred latterly to key west , owned by mr. howe , who is also possessor of this key. & quot ; hawk 's cay resort is currently located here , and the island is sometimes known by that name . <eos> history of duck key by jerry wilkinson many do not think of duck key as an old key . <eos> it was bypassed by the railroad in 1912 and the overseas highway after when rebuilt after the 1935 hurricane . <eos> as it is today at mm 61 , it is a new key . <eos> bryan newkirk purchased the island in 1956 and with a consortium of partners pumped several million dollars along with many million cubic yards of fill . <eos> if you are uncertain where duck key is located , look to the upper right of the map chosen by name . <eos> like most of the keys , duck key was unnamed on early spanish charts . <eos> it was included as one of the & quot ; key vaccas & quot ; , or cow keys . <eos> it is not specifically named on the 1733 spanish treasure recovery maps . <eos> a 1772 chart by debrahm labels it as reynolds ; however , william gerard de brahm , a swiss , gave many the keys his own names . <eos> he was the first surveyor general for british east florida . <eos> again it took george gauld to name it duck key in his chart of 1775. gauld names the west end of & quot ; duck key & quot ; as a fresh water source in his & quot ; of the watering places on the florida keys. & quot ; gauld did a credible job of surveying the keys ; however , was interrupted by the revolutionary war of 1776. land ownership anyway , key vaca and four small islands were granted to don francisco ferreira by a spanish land grant in 1814. therefore , duck key was part of one of two spanish land grants in the keys , key west being the other . <eos> while under spanish ownership , ferreira of st. augustine petitioned on january 4 , 1814 & quot ; to his excellency the governor . <eos> . . . & quot ; to grant him & quot ; . <eos> . . in absolute property a key situated among those called the florida keys , and is also know as key baca and also four small islands which are situated in the vicinity. . . & quot ; it was approved the next day & quot ; as the services rendered by the petitioner are well known , and in consideration of the great losses which he has suffered by the revolution. . . & quot ; duck key belonged to ferreira . <eos> when florida became an american possession in 1821 and its board of florida land commissioners accepted ferreira 's claim which was later approved by an act of congress , may 26 , 1830. others in the u. s. and florida governments treated the five islands as public domain and transferred ownership for various programs . <eos> the positive legal ownership debate goes on and on , but was evidently resolved in 1899. duck key was excluded from some of the legal discussions as ferreira had sold key vaca to isaac cox for $ 3,000 on september 4 , 1824 , ( deed book e , st. johns county , florida ) which was $ 1,000 more than the selling price of key west . <eos> three years later , cox sold key vaca ( all five islands ) to charles howe of indian key fame for $ 1,500 . <eos> however , another case of the spanish owners selling land twice as they did key west , ferreira also sold duck key to sol snyder on june 11 , 1823. the author believes that state surveyor charles smith 's note , see image , was really meant for grassy key a part of which was on the same survey chart . <eos> grassy key , key vacca , hog key and knight 's key owners fought land title battles until 1899. for the researcher , lewis w. pierce and horatio crain , charles howe 's son-in-law were prominent players . <eos> salt ponds there are references to salt ponds on duck key in the early 1800s . <eos> the industry is well documented in key west involving some the city leaders as simonton , fitzpatrick , whitehead , fleming , etc . <eos> the lafayette salt company was incorporated in 1829 and began production in earnest in 1834. today , the american society is trying to reduce salt intake ; however , if necessary many acclaimed chefs still suggest the natural element of sea salt or & quot ; fleur de sel. & quot ; before refrigeration , salt was absolutely necessary for prolonged food preservation , processing and shipment . <eos> it is believed that salt production was the goal for charles howe 's acquiring duck key in 1827. the key west register on april 9 , 1829 printed : & quot ; election notice - in pursuance of law . <eos> . . the following named persons to be the judges of the election , which will be held the first monday in may , next for a - delegate to congress on indian key , the store of thomas gibson - judges : charles howe , joseph prince and thomas gibson . <eos> . . . & quot ; it is about 30 miles from indian key to duck key and indian key had the only store next to key west ; therefore , was it possible for him to be living on duck key ? <eos> the 1830 census , which did not list specific locations and only the name of the head of the household , listed charles howe as a household of 13 members , five of which were slaves . <eos> therefore , the slaves could have been operating the salt ponds . <eos> early salt production was labor intensive . <eos> generally the lower technology consisted of gates to allow seawater to enter evaporation vats at high tide , close the gates , allow evaporation , allow more seawater , etc . <eos> until a brine was obtained , siphon off the brine into a separate pickle vat , then to a crystallizing vat , where the salt was raked off , dried and bagged . <eos> as this required considerable construction , the author believes that even a simpler method was used at duck key . <eos> charles howe was appointed and confirmed a monroe county justice of the peace on january 18 , 1831. john lee williams in his 1837 territory of florida wrote : & quot ; duck key is a narrow rocky islet , containing some fine salt ponds . <eos> mr. howe , from charleston , made a considerable establishment on the island for the purpose of making salt , but having died since , the project has been abandoned . <eos> it is about two miles long. & quot ; was williams wrong about howe 's death are was there another charles howe ? <eos> the charles howe of indian key was born august 12,1801 in massachusetts and married his first wife , ann cole on april 20 , 1825 , had three children , sarah , edward and charles jr. , and he died january 27 , 1873 in hadley , mass . <eos> his son charles jr. married in 1852 a mary ann johnson of duck key . <eos> the land deed of isaac n. cox to charles howe of key vacas , & quot ; . <eos> . . charles howe , of the city of charleston , the state of south carolina. & quot ; however , horatio crain , howe 's son-in-law , in 1885 stated to the land commission that & quot ; my father-in-law , charles howe , who had the salt works there and who subsequently sold to willaim c. dennis whose heirs hold the title. & quot ; of interest are excerpts from the charleston daily courier dated january 10 , 1858 of a voyage made to knight 's key with charles howe : & quot ; . . .commenced with knight 's key , containing about one hundred and twenty-five acres of arable [ plowable ] land , and has a comfortable house and cistern . <eos> on this key we have twelve hundred cocoanut trees and about fifty thousand sisal hemp plants , most of which are fit to cut and manufacture into hemp .... & quot ; they sailed on & quot ; ... passed duck key , where much money was expended on forming a salt pond .... & quot ; regardless , there were salt ponds on duck key and later charles howe obtained controlling interest in the salt works in key west in 1843 , then sole ownership after the hurricane of 1846. the state survey the keys in the 1870s and the duck key portion of map is shown to the right . <eos> duck key is about the same size as the kingdom of monaco and set for a major change . <eos> modern day duck key duck key took a herculean leap forward in 1951. bryan w. newkirk , an internationally know financier and mining executive purchased the island for about $ 4,000,000 to make it a 400 acre island community . <eos> newkirk had made coral gables , florida his winter home since 1924 and had definite ideas for the island 's amenities . <eos> an airport was available 12 miles away at marathon ; however , a golf course and yacht club would be needed and an improved 16,000 foot entrance causeway . <eos> by 1952 a wooden bridge connected duck key to highway u.s. 1 and construction really took off with alonzo cothron of islamorada as the principal contractor . <eos> the interconnecting canals were the source of landfill . <eos> on january 2 , 1953 , the million dollar causeway from us 1 to duck key was officially opened for vehicle traffic . <eos> state representative bernie c. papy was the master of ceremony . <eos> newkirk was smarter than other developers and made all his canals through waterways so they could flush with the tidal changes . <eos> actually , he made five islands , indies , centre , harbour , plantation and yacht club islands . <eos> there are about 10 miles of paved roads and four decorative stone bridges not including the entrance causeway . <eos> ownership changed in 1983 when the pompano beach barrington group purchased the holdings and made extensive changes . <eos> the resort was the hawk 's cay resort and marina . <eos> additional swimming pools and recreational facilities were added in the late 1990s . <eos> the singh company of key west , well known for the truman annex , entered the upper keys in the middle 1990s and began hawk 's cay village . <eos> this added several hundred caribbean style cottages all with water views , porches and the traditional white picket fence . <eos> all in all there must be approaching 400 homes , multiple recreational facilities and complete convention facilities . <eos> duck key is now ( 2004 ) struggling with keys wide wastewater disposal problems . <eos> hawk 's cay resort has a treatment plant , but the individual homes are on septic tanks .
un jour de grande chance
stroll though the state park , about 15 miles from marathon -- quite a few shore birds , not much else .
the beach party
the water was a balmy 46 degrees ... not bad really for the middle of winter . <eos> < a href= '' http : //mordac.org/seattle/polar_bear_2010/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > mordac.org/seattle/polar_bear_2010/ < /a >
first snow on ingolstadt and freezing temperatures .
we set out with the intention of getting close to the bos 400 shipwreck located off duiker point in moari bay , around the corner from hout bay . <eos> starting at the dunes on the slopes of the karbonkelberg , overlooking sandy bay , we followed rocket road to the end , right up until the big cairn . <eos> at this point we chose the top path instead of the one leading down to oude schip point , which forks at a point past < a href= '' http : //www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx ? guid=ebb362d2-de6e-4cfd-bd05-7f7d6a23394a '' rel= '' nofollow '' > rocket house < /a > - one path continues down to the point , while the other follows the coastline around the bay to the bos 400 wreck ( and continues on to hout bay ) . <eos> unfortunately the upper very narrow and badly-eroded & quot ; trail & quot ; leads to much bundu-bashing and rock scrambling , and eventually a dead end . <eos> < a href= '' http : //runkeeper.com/user/coda/activity/64374678 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > map on runkeeper < /a >

when i first decided to participate in the 26 things project in june 2003 , like most people i thought it would be a piece of cake . <eos> i mean , twenty-six photographs over a month with thirty-one days ? <eos> that 's less than one photo per day ! <eos> easy ! <eos> it was n't until i started , however , that i realised just how wrong i was . <eos> anyone can just go around snapping this and that , but where 's the creativity ? <eos> and what happens when your creative muse abandons you ? <eos> this was my dilemma . <eos> things may have started off well enough , but the engine of creation soon stalled . <eos> my lack of interest in my environment was like sugar in the gas tank . <eos> i did n't want to take just any old photos , yet as the days went by and my inspiration came to nought , well , as they say , desperate times called for desperate measures . <eos> whereas at the start of the month i was an auteur with visions of perfection , by the end i was a hack , snapping away feversihly just to beat the deadline . <eos> as a result , i am happy with only about half of the photographs i have taken for this project over the last four weeks . <eos> some were the victims of lost opportunity , or bad timing . <eos> most are affected by an unwanted dullness -- a frustrating symptom of the grey , overcast skies we 're so well-known for here . <eos> and a few are the result of sheer lack of imagination on my part , beyond salvation -- even with all the photoshopping in the world . <eos> ( you 'll know it to look at them . ) <eos> but do n't let that put you off too much , for there 's more than a handful of diamonds in this rough . <eos> i might even go so far as to say that photographs such as this one , or this one , could well be some of the best i 've ever taken . <eos> not bad for a novice , eh ?
for the first time in a whale 's age , noenders new and old met up at the beach chalet . <eos> after sundown , we went across the street onto ocean beach and did the bon ( e ) fire thing .

i developed a roll of ektar 100 , and found to my horror that the negatives were almost clear , with just a very faint ghost of an image on them . <eos> so i put a strip in my scanner , just to see what i got , and these are some of the results . <eos> i 'm actually quite amazed how much detail teh scanner rescued , but it does look like there was a heck of a lot of crap on the film !

meat workers vote for short solidarity strike press release : new zealand meat workers union thursday , 1 march 2010 at 7:00am meat workers vote for short solidarity strike 1,700 affco meat workers will strike for a day in solidarity with 750 locked out co-workers from 5am this friday march 2. the talley 's owned company locked out over 750 union members indefinetly at five of its eight plants after only 10 hours of face-to-face negotiations , says meat worker 's union general secretary dave eastlake . <eos> the lockout notice does n't apply to 1,000 union members at moerewa ( northland ) , horotiu ( waikato ) , feilding , whanganui and wairoa or 700 members at the company 's three other plants in wiri ( auckland ) , rangiuru ( te puke ) and napier . <eos> mr eastlake says this mornings final count of yesterday 's secret strike ballots shows the overwhleming majority support the action which includes a week long work ban on training replacement labour for locked out workers . <eos> & quot ; it only took talley 's 10 hours of face-to-face negotiations before they decided to lock out affco workers and cause unncessary suffering to their families and the already struggling rural communities which rely on their incomes , & quot ; he says . <eos> & quot ; we regret this disruption to farmers , but workers would n't be striking in solidarity with their workmates if they had n't been locked out. & quot ; the union wants the lockout lifted immediately and for the company to get back in meaninful bargaining , he says . <eos> & quot ; this dispute is not about pay rises . <eos> talley 's want the workers to work harder and faster for the same work , with less workers and for less money. & quot ; ends 1. the company claims the parties have been bargaining for 18 months . <eos> the current collective agreement ( contract ) expired on 31 december 2011. under the employment relations act parties ca n't legally start bargaining until 60 days before the collective agreement expired . <eos> the first negotiations began on 30 november 2011 . <eos> 2. the work ban starts on saturday 3 march at 5am and ends on friday 9 march at 9am . <eos> using replacement labour would extend the length of the lockout the the financial burden on workers . <eos> regional contacts are available through mwu media liason simon oosterman on 021 885 410 mwu national secretary david eastlake on 0274 322 421

the second football game i 've shot for the daily , and i think i did a much better job . <eos> it was also a much bigger game . <eos> exciting one , too ! <eos> to relive some of the best plays , < a href= '' http : //flickr.com/photos/fling93/314593566/in/set-72157594406206016/ '' > start here < /a > to see the flurry at the end of the first half or < a href= '' http : //flickr.com/photos/fling93/316230187/in/set-72157594406206016/ '' > here for what i consider to be the play of the game < /a > . <eos> also , our new photo editor at the daily , < a href= '' http : //flickr.com/photos/zachbeecher/ '' > zach < /a > , put together a < a href= '' http : //files.thespartandaily.com/multimedia/sjsufsu/index.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > neat multimedia show using his and my shots < /a > . <eos> photography-geek talk follows , so skip the rest of this text if not interested and go view the photos . <eos> anyway , i liked using the 80-200 in the first game , and ended up with some good shots , so i used it again even though people were suggesting the 300 or 400. i did n't like the 300 when i used it , and i think a zoom is really crucial for sports shooting . <eos> anyway , i think i did a better job capturing some key plays this time , although they all had to be cropped in a fair amount . <eos> maybe i 'll try using a 300 next time and shoot from the end zone instead of the sidelines ? <eos> but i really do n't relish the thought of lugging that huge lens around .

while on a recent us tour supporting m83 , sweden 's i break horses stopped into room 205 for a deeply weird live session during a brutal heatwave . <eos> it was hot and they were sick as dogs , so they stripped to their underwear before a single note warbled from their synths . <eos> even so , the vibe created by the white light/white heat/white underwear delivered the first almost-perfect episode of room 205. huge thanks to ibh and director forrest borie for making it through the wilderness . <eos> enjoy . <eos> bio welcome to the densely layered world of i break horses , the nom de plume of maria lindén and musical partner fredrik balck . <eos> residing in stockholm , sweden , the duo quietly crafted their 2011 debut album hearts via stolen moments gathered up over a span of three years . <eos> although heavily ( and openly ) influenced by mbv , slowdive and jesus & amp ; mary chain , i break horses is far from an exercise in typical shoegaze fare . <eos> coupled with lindén 's vocal , a gorgeous scandinavian croon bathed in layers of oceanic reverb and tremelo , and god only knows how many synths , drum pads and ornately effected guitar chords , i break horses offers a unique sonic experience unlike anything else you 'll soon hear . <eos> components video  youtube : < a href= '' http : //youtube.com/playlist ? list=plc4eeuwd7e4k9rpmvqexos5-fhqjmym2t '' rel= '' nofollow '' > youtube.com/playlist ? list=plc4eeuwd7e4k9rpmvqexos5-fhqjmym2t < /a >  vimeo : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/album/2244936 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/album/2244936 < /a > photos  flickr : < a href= '' http : //flic.kr/s/ahsjbzas8l '' rel= '' nofollow '' > flic.kr/s/ahsjbzas8l < /a > music  soundcloud : < a href= '' http : //soundcloud.com/goincase/sets/i-break-horses-at-room-205 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > soundcloud.com/goincase/sets/i-break-horses-at-room-205 < /a > credits executive producer  incase : < a href= '' http : //goincase.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > goincase.com < /a > producer  arlie carstens : < a href= '' http : //disastercasual.typepad.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > disastercasual.typepad.com < /a > director  forrest borie : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/forrestborie '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/forrestborie < /a > set designer  tamarra younis : < a href= '' http : //union-of-art.net '' rel= '' nofollow '' > union-of-art.net < /a > audio engineer  j. clark : < a href= '' http : //facebook.com/jason.clark.752 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > facebook.com/jason.clark.752 < /a > camera  forrest borie : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/forrestborie '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/forrestborie < /a >  conor simpson : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/likeamaniac '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/likeamaniac < /a >  jeffrey peters : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/user2059918 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/user2059918 < /a >  arlie carstens : < a href= '' http : //disastercasual.typepad.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > disastercasual.typepad.com < /a > director of photography  jeffrey peters : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/user2059918 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/user2059918 < /a > editor  forrest borie : < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/forrestborie '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/forrestborie < /a > photos  arlie carstens : < a href= '' http : //disastercasual.typepad.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > disastercasual.typepad.com < /a > performing artist  i break horses : < a href= '' http : //ibreakhorses.se '' rel= '' nofollow '' > ibreakhorses.se < /a > label  bella union : < a href= '' http : //bellaunion.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > bellaunion.com < /a > room 205 theme song  cora foxx : < a href= '' http : //theheapsf.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > theheapsf.com < /a >

what every girl really wants .
katelyn is quickly becoming one of my favorite models - she also gives new meaning to the adage about great things coming in small packages . <eos> katelyn is very dependable ( no flake in her ! <eos> ) , photogenic , fun , sweet , creative , and a bit of a contortionist too - she is an absolute joy to shoot with . <eos> rebecca and i were going to shoot downtown with several models but katelyn was the only one that showed so we wore the poor girl out - but it was a lot of fun - until she stood on a park bench , caught her stiletto heel in the bench and ended up falling into the street ; fortunately the street was ok and katelyn ended up bruised and battered but she still hung in there - now i ca n't wait to shoot with her again ! <eos> we did this shoot with katelyn in downtown anchorage in august 2012 .

april 17 , 2010 was the 27th consecutive month of peaceful global protests against the scientology cult . <eos> at last month 's protest in clearwater a passing motorist yelled & quot ; fuck those cocksuckers , every last one of them ! & quot ; , which produced lots of lols . <eos> so this month 's protest theme in clearwater was that citizen 's suggestion . <eos> since last month 's protest the scientology cult has been in the news across the globe quite a bit and the public is becoming more and more educated about it 's true malicious nature . <eos> from march 29 to april 2nd 2010 anderson cooper 360 's weeklong coverage of & quot ; scientology : a history of violence & quot ; . <eos> part 1 < a href= '' http : //www.cnn.com/video/ ?

the annual comic con international 's 2012 edition , which was held at san diego convention center on july 11-15 , 2012. it does n't get any geekier than this . <eos> thanks to a guest pass from one of the presenters ( a good friend of mine ) , i was able to visit the convention on the 14th .

i was ready to roll after a short nap , but it took the guys a little longer to adjust . <eos> and then they only wanted to go eat and head right back to the hotel . <eos> i wound up on a solo photowalk , which was just fine .

u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner joined gov . <eos> chris gregoire may 18 for a tour of the port to emphasize how important exports are to stimulating the economy . <eos> geithner and gregoire toured a marine terminal and rail yard to view american-made construction equipment and container cargo bound for asia . <eos> also , geithner 's exclusive interview with cnbc anchor erin burnett was filmed on port docks later in the afternoon .
when you open the package , there are 5 big pieces for easy assembly plus a single tree with three landing gear legs , four tires and wheels , two props , a bunch of landing gear doors and six underwing pylons . <eos> your trusty fingers are enough to take it all apart , to reveal the nice kit you 've got including a little , clear , cradle to hold the tail up i believe the label ( last frame ) is telling us this is abs , so you need an abs-friendly glue if you plan to glue it together . <eos> still , its a nice collection of parts , at least as good as a minicraft 1/144 , and attractively priced . <eos> note that there is a mad boom , which extends , and that the starboard horizontal stabilizer has been painted upside down - should be gray on top , white on bottom this will be a fun build !
my car is having some repairs . <eos> julie 's car needed some repairs . <eos> she borrowed a car . <eos> it broke down . <eos> then her car was repaired . <eos> i followed jim and julie to go pick up her car . <eos> she and i stopped by starbucks to attempt to send photos by email from my new camera using the t-mobile shotspot at starbucks . <eos> then the next day i followed jim to pick up the car that she 'd borrowed after it was repaired . <eos> i took advantage of the drive and snapped photos around valdosta , georgia , usa . <eos> it was a beautiful , sunny december day in south georgia -- 76 degrees fahrenheit . <eos> later , jim and i went to pick up my car after it 'd been repaired .
i went for a random walk in a place called simon 's wood , near to wokingham . <eos> i experimented with my camera kit a bit - these are the non-hideous experiments !

captain miles malone is the british forces ’ only vet in afghanistan . <eos> dubbed “ the herriot of helmand , ” he has become a minor sensation in the province after starting a raft of veterinary clinics for local farmers . <eos> his principal job is caring for the dogs that sniff for roadside bombs and provide protection to the troops on duty . <eos> keeping them at their peak is important , as the work they do here saves lives . <eos> however , in the seven months that he has been in helmand , the 28 year old from mount bures , near sudbury , in suffolk , has begun a series of monthly clinics for the remote farming communities around the main british base , camp bastion , and they have proved wildly popular . <eos> with only a few weeks to go before his tour of duty in helmand comes to an end he packed his kit and prepared a selection of drugs for another clinic . <eos> in two hardened cool boxes he can carry enough equipment to treat up to two thousand animals . <eos> while he has been running regular clinics , this one was different . <eos> it took an raf chinook to fly him out to a small , newly constructed , patrol base established after the largest helicopter assault codenamed operation moshtarak pushed the taliban out of nad ali . <eos> after landing at patrol base shaheed which was set up by soldiers of b company , the 1st battalion the royal welsh , he was straight out on a patrol to spread the word . <eos> out here the range of animals are a little different but , to the farmers , they are their lifeblood . <eos> “ these animals are basically their back accounts . <eos> some of these goats are worth $ 70 each . <eos> a lot of people round here are surviving on about a dollar a day so economically they are extremely important , ” said captain miles malone . <eos> over this tour the clinics have had a noticeable effect , not only on the health of the herds , but in loosening the grip of the taliban over the people also . <eos> captain malone has treated over 8,000 animals , and this clinic at shaheed has added a further 61 farmers to his program . <eos> in contrast to the gentle adventures of james herriot in north yorkshire , captain malone ’ s work is at the other end of the spectrum , undertaken with the protection of well-armed afghan and british soldiers . <eos> “ there is very little understanding among the local farmers of veterinary care or basic animal husbandry . <eos> so i split my time when i run clinics between treating the flocks and educating the farmers . <eos> the taliban just can not compete , ” said captain miles malone . <eos> “ the village that we are living in is largely an agricultural community . <eos> having the opportunity for a vet to come down and deliver medication , treatment and also advice to the local farmers has been a real win . <eos> in part because it displays our intent to stay here and that our actions are in support of the community . <eos> but it also adds back to the economy here because it increases the value of the livestock and educates the farmers , so it is a win on both fronts , ” said major ed hill , officer commanding b company 1st battalion the royal welsh at patrol base shaheed . <eos> but what of the future and sustaining this work ? <eos> captain malone ’ s replacement has just arrived and following on from his success a second military vet has been sent out to concentrate on expanding the clinics . <eos> while the military may have started the ball rolling , they need the afghans to take over and run it for themselves . <eos> this is where non-government organisations like the society for the protection of animals abroad are helping . <eos> they are working to train afghan veterinary technicians who can continue the work long after the british troops have gone home . <eos> picture credit : major paul smyth crown copyright

the aftermath of the saturday g20 protests as seen on yonge street north of dundas square
we called the evening “ coal river revival ” and it was to be the last show of our season . <eos> why ? <eos> we don ’ t spend august on a white sand beach . <eos> we wanted to experience a sum up of our year of mountaintop removal ( mtr ) resistance , and do this with a congregation that has been pushing back at the exploding mountains for decades . <eos> so for last saturday ’ s worship C charleston w. va. was our destination . <eos> it defined how far we ’ ve come in our intentional community this year , in our choices , our impact - and our haunted exhaustion . <eos> the history-making crime of mtr has changed our world all the way from the boroughs of new york , where we consume the power that the martyred mountains provide . <eos> now , a couple days later - charleston rings in us like the memory of a mesmerizing opera . <eos> we especially remember the interactive mountain rituals . <eos> the one that changed the course of the evening was the calling out of the 500 names of the missing mountains . <eos> that when we raised the lights on the hundreds of appalachians in the room , staring at that list of names in their hands and recognizing the folks next them who were also shouting mountains C oh that ’ s our neighbors on another side of the same mountain ! <eos> the cry of the mountain names rose in the room like a fast climb with friends . <eos> coming from 600 miles away we could play host to a gathering of lots of mountain activists who might not mix much . <eos> everyone from 90 year old west virginian eco-legend ken hechler to climate ground zero to rainforest action network to the love art lab to appalachia watch to pennies of promise ( the project to save marsh fork elementary school from a 3 million gallon lake of coal waste ) . <eos> all these citizens of different styles and strategies clapped their hands with us , and with one another . <eos> at the end of two hours , they gave us a wonderful ovation , and we gave them one back from the stage . <eos> a unifying was in the works that should grow all the way to the big march on washington in two months , on sept 25-27 , “ appalachia rising. ” the next morning , we drove up coal river valley , through the dead and dying coal towns , with commentary from larry gibson , the “ keeper of the mountain , ” and our friend bo webb . <eos> we walked up into the horrific dull white stone space where kayford mountain had lived for millions of years . <eos> then we sang and prayed to that mountain , and made our way out of that hell , back to our long ride home . <eos> now writing thank you notes all day . <eos> it seems the “ coal river revival ” showed us how far we have to go . <eos> we ’ ve got to sing and preach back in new york ! <eos> banks that finance mtr C hey ubs ! <eos> C you need to get down on your knees and pray ! <eos> exploding mountains for the coal ? <eos> oh , you bankers need to come to church in your lobbies ! <eos> appalachia-lujah !

over 100,000 people live in & quot ; cage homes & quot ; . <eos> they are apartments that are divided up into individual units . <eos> i visited one apartment ( probably about 650 square feet ) that had been divided into 22 units . <eos> double stacked . <eos> residents on the lower level could just about stand , the upper levels were about 3.5 ft high . <eos> residents in those i saw , shared a single kitchen and toilet . <eos> these have wooden partitions , not the more widely seen wire ones . <eos> wood affords more privacy but lacks ventilation . <eos> i ca n't imagine how terrible it would be to live here in the summer with no windows . <eos> the cage dwellings are not cheap . <eos> the upper ones cost about $ 500 hkd a month and the lower ones about $ 1,000 . <eos> these photographs were taken on a visit to determine how a charitable organisation could best assist the residents and will be used for publicity for this cause .

george the giant set the world record for the total weight of concrete blocks broken while resting on his chest while laying on a bed of nails . <eos> 40 blocks at an average weight of 34.5 pounds each make 1380 pounds total concrete . <eos> then there 's the 30-ish pound platform and of course george 's own weight all resting on the bed of nails . <eos> and that 's before you start swinging sledge hammers to break the blocks . <eos> oh , and did i mention that they set the blocks on fire ? <eos> & quot ; ouch & quot ; seemed like the word of the day . <eos> all this took place as the half-time entertainment during an arena football match on the home turf of the bakersfield blitz .

to commemorate this historical event i took loads of pictures of dudes with no shirts and far away views of the stage .

yeah , it 's as good as it looks .
again , i want to emphasize - this was chad 's idea : ) i merely helped execute . <eos> it felt good to really use the kitchen , which we do far too little of . <eos> anyways , a great time was had by all and we had a real good mix at the party and the after-party was a blast as well .

the day of the dead parade 2005 in san fransisco . <eos> the parade runs yearly around the mission district of sf .
according to my guide , these tunnels were once used by servants , back when bryn mawr was for rich girls who could afford servants and servants were cheaper . <eos> supposedly the servants would enter and exit from various doorways in the dorms , carrying their young charges ' laundry , food , etc . <eos> underground so as to be seen as little as possible . <eos> this is of course hearsay , as my guide was not around at the same time as the servants . <eos> today the tunnels seem to mostly contain random junk , along with pipes and wires of all shapes and sizes . <eos> with a cursory googling i have only been able to uncover a handful of articles about the tunnels under bryn mawr , most notably < a href= '' http : //www.biconews.com/2008/11/24/tunneling-through-the-ghosts-of-bryn-mawr/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > tunneling through the ghosts of bryn mawr < /a > from the bi-college news . <eos> little historical information seems to exist online , so we may never know the facts about the nature and origins of these tunnels .

manchester metropolitan university organised a series of three guided walks during summer 2006 along manchester 's oxford road . <eos> i attended the 'radical road ' walk on 9th september 2006 , following a route designed by the well-known guide < a href= '' http : //www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0 , ,1701933,00.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > jonathan schofield < /a > . <eos> according to the organisers , manchester is & quot ; the most radical of british cities & quot ; and has & quot ; a tradition of progressive thought that spans 370 years & quot ; . <eos> we walked and looked at places connected with the this past , some with little left now to remind us of these times . <eos> these photos were taken on the day . <eos> the commentary and notes attached to image are as important as the photos , if not more so . <eos> ( unfortunately , i managed to lose the group when i was taking pictures of public enterprise . <eos> they visited the former site of the < a href= '' http : //www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/manchester/trails/tra25555.html ? ixsid= & amp ; trailpage=6 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > little ireland < /a > slum , near oxford road railway station , a place studied by a proto-communist friedrich engels for his book the condition of the working classes in england ( 1844 ) ) .

bunia prison had kids and adults mixed together . <eos> most of the kids were detained prior to trial most of them had been there months . <eos> working with a local ngo we arranged that an abandoned part of the prison was rehabiliated and used only for women and children . <eos> this action was prescient 2 months after these pictures were taken during a prison riot several inmates were killed . <eos> the children in their seperate compound were ok .

the rillito river is n't a normal river . <eos> it does n't run unless it rains . <eos> it used to . <eos> in the 1930 's there was so much water boats went up and down . <eos> but so much groundwater has been pumped from tucson 's aquifers that the river ca n't hold water . <eos> there 's a bike path that goes along the river , and it ends at a train line and i-10 . <eos> under the freeway the walls are covered with graffiti . <eos> in 2006 a huge flood washed all sorts of sand and debris down the river , so most of the graffiti is invisible .

how to connect your ipod to an audi a3 with an rsn-e navigation plus system connected to a sirius satellite radio and a six disc cd changer ... this set-up uses a dension ice & gt ; link gateway 400 which connects the ipod via the cd changer wire , and allows swapping the ipod with the cd changer via a switch . <eos> i purchased this kit at enfig.com . <eos> they are very friendly and knowledgeable . <eos> important notes : * this kit works with pre-wired vehicles , meaning the cd changer is installed . <eos> it uses the 12-pin vw pre-wired kit . <eos> if your car is set-up differently , you made need a different kit . <eos> always call the dension dealer to verify which kit you need to order . <eos> * this kit allows control via the steering wheel and rns-e mmi controls . <eos> but , it does not transmit id3 info or cd text due to a limitation in the cd changer control wiring . <eos> it is a limitation of the rns-e , not the dension . <eos> the a3 is not equipped with a true mmi ( which uses optical wiring- and does support id3/cd text ) . <eos> it is an rns-e with an mmi interface . <eos> * you can not swap while the car is running . <eos> you must shut the car down and leave it powered down for some time before the swap takes place . <eos> this is because the audi stays powered for 10 minutes after the keys are removed and the alarm is set . <eos> * the gateway 400 is no longer being produced . <eos> instead , there is an intermediate accessory you can use with a gateway 300. enfig is still selling the 400s while they last .

we took our first trip to the new outdoor sculpture garden run by the seattle art museum . <eos> i thought it was going to be very very good . <eos> instead , it was fantastic . <eos> remarkable use of space . <eos> great harmony among natural , manmade forms . <eos> integration of existing infrastructure , surrounding landscape and buildings . <eos> the only flaw is that they did not conceive of how to protect sculpture that should not be touched . <eos> there is no separation from the art , which implies a relationship to the art that involves touching , frankly . <eos> the calder , for instance , in other situations was touched all the time . <eos> not here . <eos> on the other hand , i do n't see how you could have the physical relationship with the enormous serra pieces without being able to walk ( or run ) among them .

about 80 km north of guilin china is a vast region of terraced rice fields -- dragon 's backbone rice terraces -- the most amazing in the world . <eos> they were built over 300 years from the late 1200s to the early 1600s , during the yuan and qing dynasty 's , and are still actively maintained and farmed today . <eos> aimee and i stayed for two days in the small village of dazhai in this region , a town that has only very recently opened to tourists . <eos> we hiked up and down amongst the terraces +/- about 1000 feet , of 2500ish , and between several of the villages . <eos> we stayed with a beautiful and sweet local family who operates a small guest house . <eos> ( aimee and i earned a pretty scary spider story at their place ! ) <eos> the locals in the region are zhuang people , one of 55 distinct chinese minority groups . <eos> my time in this town was my ( nate ) first experiences surviving completely without language . <eos> we played with some of the little kids , and tried to teach each other words , using just pictures , smiles , guestures and body language . <eos> we had a small phrase book with they loved , and after some struggle we got their address and agreed to send them one when we get home . <eos> it 's hard to describe the true awesomness of this region , on many levels . <eos> these photos are good , but it really needs to be seen to be even partially comprehended . <eos> -- - once you 've looked at these photos as a set , check them out individually because aimee and i each added descriptions to many of them with more details .

colonized by the minoans in 3000 bc , this volcanic island erupted in 1450 bc , forming santorini 's crescent shape . <eos> the island is widely believed to be a candidate for the lost kingdom of atlantis . <eos> named thira by the dorians when they settled here in the 8th century bc , it was renamed santorini , after st irene , by the venetians , who conquered the island in the 13th century . <eos> despite tourism , santorini remains a stunning island with its white villages clinging to volcanic cliffs above black sand beaches . <eos> for more photos of greece , see these albums : < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72057594113817349/ '' > athens < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72057594130495651/ '' > mykonos < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72057594130488583/ '' > delos < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/sets/72157594146094534/ '' > delphi < /a >

what a joy to be included in the des moines flick group . <eos> it was fun to stroll around the city this saturday afternoon . <eos> the weather was pretty good , mid 40s ... could have been 5 below . <eos> the sun was in and out . <eos> it was fun to see this nice city at work and play on a quiet saturday afternoon . <eos> i had the pleasure of bringing along an exchange student from bangledesh , giving him a walking tour of our city ! <eos> his pictures were great and hopefully his memories will be even greater . <eos> probably , the best part of this journey was having the opportunity to meet a super nice group of people in des moines that share an interest in photography . <eos> after everyone walked the city , we all met back for food and fellowship at java joes . <eos> it was a delightful event . <eos> i look forward to participating in more of these events ! <eos> for the group picture and more information , see the < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/don3rdse/6657205163/in/faves-librariesrock '' > group photo by don3rdse < /a > !

< a href= '' http : //www.cincinnatiusa.com/attractions/detail.asp ? attractionid=63 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > the william howard taft national historic site < /a > < i > commemorates the only man to serve as president and chief justice of the united states . <eos> the house that taft was born in has been restored to its original appearance . <eos> a visit to the site includes a tour of the restored birthplace and four period rooms that reflect the family life during taft 's boyhood . <eos> the home also includes second floor exhibits highlighting taft 's life and career . <eos> the taft education center , located adjacent to the birthplace , houses an orientation video , exhibits on later generations of the taft family , and classrooms for visiting schools . <eos> the signature exhibit of the center is an animatronic figure of the president 's son , charlie taft . <eos> charlie tells stories about different family members. < /i > < a href= '' http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_howard_taft_national_historic_site '' rel= '' nofollow '' > william howard taft national historic site < /a > < i > is a national historic site in cincinnati , ohio , maintained by the national park service of the united states . <eos> it was established in 1969. the home is located in the mount auburn historic district , a once-affluent suburb about a mile ( 1.6 km ) north of downtown cincinnati , but now within the cincinnati city limits . <eos> the two-story greek revival house , built circa 1835 , is a reminder of the elegant era when wealthier people here could escape the dirt , heat , smoke and crowded conditions of the lower city . <eos> william howard taft 's father , alphonso taft , came to cincinnati from vermont in 1839 to establish a law practice . <eos> he moved his family to this house ten years later . <eos> alphonso taft became an early supporter of the republican party in cincinnati . <eos> he lived in this house with his large extended family . <eos> alphonso 's wife fanny phelps taft died a year after the family moved to the mount auburn residence , in june 1852. in 1854 alphonso remarried , choosing a schoolteacher from massachusetts named louise torrey . <eos> louise taft would give birth to their second child , william howard taft , in the house on september 15 , 1857 . <eos> ( the first child had died at age fourteen months from whooping cough . ) <eos> alphonso had six children living in the house , two by fanny ( three others had died beforehand ) and four by louise . <eos> william would live in the house until he went to yale university in 1874. afterward , the taft family would spend less time in the house , starting when alphonso served in the ulysses s. grant administration . <eos> in 1878 a fire damaged the second floor and roof . <eos> alphonso and louise would lease the house in 1889 , moving to california for health reasons . <eos> william had married three years earlier , and the rest of the taft children had moved out previously as well . <eos> in may 1891 alphonso died in san diego , california , and was buried in cincinnati ; the tenants of the auburn house allowed the mourners to gather at the house for the funeral . <eos> louise eventually was able to sell the house outright , after ten years of trying , in 1899. in the 1940s the building was used as apartments , with the new owner elbert r. bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks . <eos> taft family political fortunes faltered with robert 's death in 1953 , and with charles phelps taft ii available to spearhead the movement , the william howard taft memorial association eventually acquired the house for $ 35,000 ( the assessment price ) , instead of the $ 75,000 bellinger was demanding for it . <eos> by 1961 , the house was in poor condition and needed restoration . <eos> it was declared a national historic landmark in 1964. the national park service currently operates the site as a historic house museum , so that its future upkeep is ensured. < /i >
the home of mary surratt in clinton , maryland . <eos> on june 30 , 1865 , surratt was convicted of conspiring to kill president abraham lincoln . <eos> along with louis powell , george atzerodt , and david herold , she was executed by hanging on july 7 , 1865. mary jenkins was born in may 1820 or 1823 ( sources differ ) . <eos> she married local landowner john surratt in august 1840. john surratt purchased 200 acres ( 81 ha ) of farmland near what is now clinton , maryland , in 1852 , and in 1853 he constructed a tavern and an inn there . <eos> in 1854 , john built a hotel as an addition to his tavern , and called it surratt 's hotel . <eos> the following year , the area around the hotel was known as surrattsville . <eos> john surratt , an alcoholic , died suddenly of a stroke in august 1862. mary and her son , john jr. , were strong confederate sympathizers ( as were most marylanders ) . <eos> john jr. ran a spy ring and confederate courier service out of this house . <eos> in november 1864 , mary surratt moved from this home to a townhouse she owned at 541 h street ( now known as 640 h street nw ) in washington , d.c. she was convicted of conspiracy largely on the testimony of john lloyd , the tenant who rented her surrattsville hotel . <eos> lloyd testified that she visited him on april 11 and again on april 14 , asking him to get rifles ready and dropping off binoculars and ammunition . <eos> john wilkes booth killed lincoln on the evening of april 14 , and even paid for surratt 's trip to the hotel earlier that day . <eos> mary surratt 's guilt is hotly contested to this day . <eos> she is buried in mt . <eos> olivet cemetery in d.c .

our friends e.b . <eos> and karina have lived together for 3.5 years . <eos> during that time they have been at the center of a large and ever growing random group of friends . <eos> suddenly , they have both decided to move to other parts of the world by the end of the year . <eos> so they have said goodbye to us in a fashion that suits them quite well : organizing & quot ; the great farewell race. & quot ; they got a bunch of friends together , split them into teams , and sent us on a race all over dc competing against each other as we solved clue after clue . <eos> it was possibly the most fun and the greatest laughs i have ever had . <eos> and here are some of the pictures i took along the way .

locations of the gordon riots of 1780 . <eos> “ a mob is usually a creature of very mysterious existence , particularly in a large city . <eos> where it comes from or whither it goes , few men can tell . <eos> assembling and dispersing with equal suddenness , it is as difficult to follow to its various sources as the sea itself ; nor does the parallel stop here , for the ocean is not more fickle and uncertain , more terrible when roused , more unreasonable , or more cruel . <eos> C charles dickens barnaby rudge : a tale of the riots of ‘ eighty . <eos> london , 1780 : under the leadership of prime minister lord north great britain was fighting a difficult war in her american colonies . <eos> american diplomats working in france had brought england ’ s old enemy into the battle . <eos> britain was in desperate need of more troops , and one attempt to get them had been a government bill , the catholic relief act of 1778 that was designed to lessen the obstacles to catholics serving in the military . <eos> the act inspired fierce resistance amongst protestants in both england and scotland . <eos> in 1779 violent protests against a similar act being introduced in scotland had broken out in glasgow and edinburgh . <eos> on june 2nd of 1780 60,000 members of the protestant association , led by lord george gordon , massed in london to present a petition to parliament calling for the repeal of the act . <eos> it ’ s members wore blue ribbons in their hats as a sign of unity . <eos> despite physical intimidation of the legislators , a vote on the petition that afternoon was overwhelmingly defeated . <eos> that evening catholic chapels belonging to foreign embassies were destroyed by a mob chanting “ no popery ” . <eos> although the initial violence may have been political , or sectarian , and anti-catholic violence occurred throughout the course of disturbance , the riots as they evolved over the next week became a savage and tumultuous expression of rebellion by london ’ s poorest . <eos> violence was directed at the authorities and anybody who opposed the mob , and looting was rampant . <eos> for while it looked like the government would be unable to retain control of the city . <eos> contemporaries found this taste of revolution profoundly shocking : “ the english reaction to the french revolution began well before it ’ s out break . ”

hampton national historic site , located just north of baltimore in towson , maryland , was once the center of a vast commercial , industrial and agricultural estate forged with indentured , enslaved , and paid labor . <eos> hampton reflects a central irony in u.s. history : that a nation newly created on the principles of equality and freedom could accept the institution of slavery .

frederick douglas was arguably the most influential african american of the 19th century . <eos> a statesman , newspaper publisher , abolitionist , husband , father , orator and women 's suffrage advocate , douglas was a man of strong convictions . <eos> born in slavery , douglas escaped from his master after refusing to take a beating from an overseer on a maryland plantation . <eos> he became a leading spokesman for the abolitionist movement . <eos> he turned down an invitation from john brown to join the harper 's ferry raid because he believed lawlessness did not help the anti-slavery cause . <eos> in 1865 he gave a speech at hosanna meeting house in oxford , pennsylvania that prompted my great-great grandfather , two of his brothers , and many of his friends to join the union army during the civil war . <eos> he was named ambassador to haiti in 1889. douglas and his wife anna purchased this home in 1877 , breaking a whites ' only covenant . <eos> on february 20 , 1895 , shortly after attending a women 's rights rally , douglas died in the hallway of this home . <eos> he may have been the greatest african american leader in american history . <eos> national park service website < a href= '' http : //www.nps.gov/frdo/index.htm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.nps.gov/frdo/index.htm < /a > hosanna meeting house photographs : < a href= '' http : //flickr.com/photos/bdinphoenix/sets/566946/ '' > flickr.com/photos/bdinphoenix/sets/566946/ < /a > return to < a href= '' http : //photohiker.blogspot.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > onlocation < /a >

though i had been photographing american flag scenarios for many years , in connection the ongoing series 'absolute amnerican ' and 'now ai n't that america ? <eos> ' , which often involved human subjects as a result of the 11 september 2001 terrorists attack on america beginning on 12 september i would began the 'god bless america ! ' <eos> project < a href= '' http : //hometown.aol.com/elvertxbarnes/godblessamericaproject.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > hometown.aol.com/elvertxbarnes/godblessamericaproject.html < /a > whereby , over the next year or so , i would focus on the patriotic display of the american flag . <eos> though human subjects have not been excluded for the sake of this partiuclar project what would catch my attention the most were images of flags draped in windows or that hung from porhces and/or that blew in the wind ... and that , obviously , was in tribute to those who were affected by 11 september 2001 .

one gingerbread kit , three people , and a touch of insanity . <eos> friday night , i visited keith eiser and his fiancee sara otero . <eos> we were n't content just to decorate . <eos> what do you expect from a computer programmer , an engineer , and the daughter of a mathematician ?
rudcote is a 1930s house in the village of brighstone . <eos> until recently , the house was almost completely hidden from public view by the large trees surrounding it . <eos> the house , and sandy lane cottage which is nearby , are currently empty and for sale . <eos> i 've been intrigued by this house for most of my life , so i took the opportunity to have a look round and take some pictures . <eos> the house has large grounds , and is probably not a very attractive purchase to anyone with the means to afford it 's upkeep , so i think it 's likely to be bought by a developer and demolished to make way for another neat little estate of modern houses .
the first floor of our house was on the historic pottstown neighborhood house tour last year . <eos> this was the 3rd year we 've been on , and we have to work hard to get the rooms 'show ready '
i took a walk through providence 's west side today from west fountain street to rising sun mills .
on tuesday , november 29 , 2005 , i went with my friend jonathan to nogales , sonora , just across the mexico-us border and just an hour south of tucson , where we live . <eos> jonathan works for borderlinks ( see < a href= '' http : //www.borderlinks.org '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.borderlinks.org < /a > ) , a nonprofit that takes people on trips down to the nogales area to teach them about border issues and show them what life is like there . <eos> jonathan frequently leads some of these trips , and often has to go down to nogales to meet with host families and others invovled with borderlinks programs . <eos> this time , i rode along just to see what it was like , since i 'd never been to nogales before .

i stayed at the radissonsas hotel in frankfurt for 2 nights . <eos> the entire experience was quite lovely . <eos> my experience was jaded b/c of the amount of orange . <eos> not b/c i do n't like it but b/c i came from england where i was told of my recent designs that the smallest amount of orange was a totally deadly mistake in any design in all of europe . <eos> voila ... take a peek ! <eos> seriously though , my experience in the hotel was great and i would recommend it : free internet cheap ( reasonably ) room-service good ( but expensive ) breakfast

fajardo , the town where luz was born and where many of her relatives still reside , is a small but bustling community on the north eastern side of the island . <eos> ( of old its inhabitants are called 'cariduro ' or 'hard heads ' . <eos> not because of their own heads , mind you , but a long time ago there was someone from fajardo who owned a famous rooster , champion of cockfights . <eos> it was this rooster that gave the fajardonians their name ... ) the town seems to be in transition . <eos> a lot of emphasis nowadays lies on development of the tourist industry and the old inner city seems to get passed by and forgotten . <eos> a lot of beautiful old buildings ( simple wooden homes and pretty colonial townhouses ) are not in use anymore and thereforeare falling into disrepair . <eos> if something is n't done quickly i 'm afraid these places wo n't be there the next time we visit ...

green-wood cemetery is 6 avenues deep and 17 blocks wide , covering 478 acres along the hills of gowanus in sunset park . <eos> chartered in brooklyn on april 18 , 1838 , only after being rejected by manhattan , it was part of founder henry evelyn pierrepoint 's vision of brooklyn as a great european style american city . <eos> despite initial reluctance to eschew traditional graveyards for a non denominational garden graveyard , just 15 years after the first internment on september 5 , 1840 , 45,576 persons had been buried and it attracted over 100,000 visitors annually . <eos> today there are an estimated 600,000 people buried in the cemetery .

now , i 'm sure i 'm about to piss some people off , but then again , that 's what i do best . <eos> when i found out yesterday that columbus actually had a confederate graveyard , i had to go see for myself . <eos> camp chase was a union camp and confederate pow camp . <eos> over 2000 confederate dead are buried there . <eos> i do , however , love the fact that the camp is open to the public extended hours on jefferson davis day . <eos> for those of you who buy into the state-school crap about the civil war being about slavery , i will only suggest that you do some more reading and research .

804 stevens avenue , portland , me . <eos> august 2006. this is the home i grew up in , from 1978 when we moved to portland when i was in kindergarten , until i left in 1989 at the age of 16. my mother just sold it . <eos> the closing was on friday the 1st of september . <eos> thursday i helped her pack the house into a moving truck to take to her new house in south portland with my brothers and sister in law . <eos> i took a series of almost 200 pictures of it in farewell . <eos> i love this house . <eos> it will be strange not having it in the family any more , but life is full of change and things move in layers and circles around us as we move on , or break away . <eos> this house is like a strange breed of person in my mind , and i love it for all it gave me . <eos> that will never change .
unfortunately , i was only able to attend for one day , but , to quote david byrne , what a day that was !

a day in the life of me : first day of spring theme : words
a record of the national trust volunteering weekend , 14/15 april 2007 .
güell cellar - garraf , barcelona ( spain ) . <eos> this building was projected together by antoni gaudí i cornet ( who signed the project ) and francesc berenguer i mestres his disciple , in 1895. in 1882 eusebi güell commissioned gaudí to design a hunting lodge on some land he owned in the area of the garraf . <eos> this project never saw the light of day , but later , in 1895 , a cellar was built there following a design that was probably by gaudí in collaboration with francesc berenguer , to whom the building was attributed for many years . <eos> the cellar , built in local stone , is a unique triangular building based on the gaudinian parabolic arch . <eos> the walls act as a roof , and the building consists of two lower and three upper floors , including a private chapel . <eos> the exterior has a notably mediaeval look , although the architect ’ s hallmark of naturalistic elements is visible in the chimneys , as is the monogram of the güell family on the walls . <eos> forming part of the same project , the gatehouse is also built in stone and brickwork , and again we find the monogram of the güells . <eos> the main gate , in meshed ironwork , is of particular interest . <eos> on the same site there is a watchtower and alongside this a farmhouse , which are both private and closed to the public . <eos> since 1977 the complex of buildings has belonged to the granada family , who bought it from the then count güell . <eos> the part built by gaudí was used as a private house and the rest of the complex continued to be used to grow mushrooms , as it had been for many years . <eos> in 1994 the family turned the space into a restaurant : the two main halls , purpose-built as a mushroom farm , were converted into two rooms of the restaurant―the granada room and the garraf room―and the ground floor of the house became the gaudí room . <eos> source : < a href= '' http : //www.rutadelmodernisme.com/default.aspx ? idioma=en & amp ; contenido=body_sortimen.htm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.rutadelmodernisme.com/default.aspx ? idioma=en & amp ; cont ... < /a >

on april 1st , the famous landmark & quot ; bierpinsel & quot ; in berlin-steglitz was re-opened . <eos> to mark the occasion , its facade is being painted by four street artists over 6 weeks . <eos> unknown to most spectators , this art event is the brain child of a real estate marketing firm called & quot ; premise group & quot ; . <eos> its sole purpose is the pr value and the consequent increase in rental value of the building . <eos> street art was n't assasinated ; it was assimilated . <eos> rest in peace . <eos> < a href= '' http : //www.schloss-turm.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.schloss-turm.com < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.premise.eu '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.premise.eu < /a >

the programme for the 1991 hornsea carnival & quot ; cartoons & quot ; july 12th to 14th 1991
proteus is the second oldest parade at new orleans mardi gras . <eos> founded in 1882 , proteus ( & quot ; proh tee us & quot ; ) the shepherd of the oceans , is an early sea-god , one of several deities whom homer the old man of the sea has always held elaborate masked tableau balls and the most beautiful street parade to date . <eos> in 1893 the krewe first introduced the tradition of call outs , where masked costumed krewe members invited ladies in attendance to step out on the dance floor with them . <eos> this custom was then adopted by many other krewes including rex . <eos> the identity of the king of proteus is never revealed to the public . <eos> his parade float is a giant seashell and very march part of the new orleans carnival scene for generations . <eos> proteus did not parade from 1993 - 1999 but returned to parading on lundi gras ( the monday before mardi gras day , shrove tuesday , or fat tuesday ) in 2000. the parade of the krewe of proteus follows the traditional uptown or st. charles route ending on canal street . <eos> the actual krewe of proteus parade floats are still using the original chassis from the early 1880 's . <eos> the mythical proteus the son of poseidon in the olympian theology ( homer , odyssey iv . <eos> 432 ) , or of nereus and doris , or of oceanus and a naiad , and was made the herdsman of poseidon 's seals , the great bull seal at the center of the harem . <eos> he can foretell the future , but , in a mytheme familiar from several cultures , will change his shape to avoid having to ; he will answer only to someone who is capable of capturing him . <eos> from this feature of proteus comes the adjective protean , with the general meaning of & quot ; versatile & quot ; , & quot ; mutable & quot ; , & quot ; capable of assuming many forms & quot ; : & quot ; protean & quot ; has positive connotations of flexibility , versatility and adaptability . <eos> proteus is also known as a shape shifter and can assume the guise of anyone or anything he so chooses . <eos> when held fast despite his struggles , he will assume his usual form of an old man and tell the future . <eos> the so-called old man of the sea , is a prophetic sea divinity , son of either poseidon or oceanus . <eos> he usually stays on the island of pharos , near egypt , where he herds the seals of poseidon . <eos> he will foretell the future to those who can seize him , but when caught he rapidly assumes all possible varying forms to avoid prophesying . <eos> proteus [ proh-tee-us ] , like all six of neptune 's newly discovered small satellites , is one of the darkest objects in the solar system -- & quot ; as dark as soot & quot ; is not too strong of a description . <eos> discovered by stephen synnott , like saturn 's satellite , phoebe , it reflects only 6 percent of the sunlight that strikes it . <eos> proteus is about 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) in diameter , larger than nereid . <eos> it was n't discovered from earth because it is so close to neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight . <eos> proteus circles neptune at a distance of about 92,800 kilometers ( 57,700 miles ) above the cloud tops , and completes one orbit in 26 hours , 54 minutes . <eos> scientists say it is about as large as a satellite can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity . <eos> proteus is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification . <eos> it circles the planet in the same direction as neptune rotates , and remains close to neptune 's equatorial plane . <eos> < a href= '' http : //www.kreweofproteus.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.kreweofproteus.com/ < /a >

galveston may not be the most glamorous beach resort on the gulf coast , but there are definitely some nice areas on the island . <eos> it has recovered fairly quickly from hurricane ike , and some new hotels have even opened on the island ( like the four points ) . <eos> during october and november , weather on the island can be ideal , with air temperatures in the 70s , and water temperatures still in the upper 70s . <eos> ca n't say that i would recommend galveston as a destination holiday unto itself , but there 's definitely enough to keep you occupied if you happen to be passing through to catch a cruise ship .

the great knaresborough bed race has been a firm fixture of this quiet yorkshire countryside town for 46 years now . <eos> once a year , over 90 teams exert a great deal of effort into designing and decorating beds , which are first paraded and then raced through the town in a madcap dash which culminates in crossing the river nidd to reach the finish line . <eos> it is institutional british eccentricity at its very finest , and a thoroughly fun event to attend . <eos> if you 'd like to see more , < a href= '' http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=c13gnrfnzrm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > click here to view my video footage of the day 's events < /a > .

photos i took the day after the all-nighter . <eos> it was still approximately as cold as the night before ( somewhere in the -28 f range with wind chill . ) <eos> since there were n't many ( or many detailed ) statues this year ( likely due to the cold ) , i decided to see what i could do to add depth to my photos shooting in manual , taking advantage of shadows , and doing some b & amp ; w work to emphasize the contrast in mostly white on white situations , with the exception of the first image .

the haute route day 2 took us from the trient hut through the col des ecandies , down the val  arpette to champex and on to the mont fort hut in the verbier ski area . <eos> this was a day with very little up , but the flat ski into champex was of a treacherous nature . <eos> the ski into the top of the val  arpette from from the col des ecandies was all powder . <eos> we had nice coffee and pastry in champex . <eos> the cab ride to verbier was scenic too . <eos> great lunch in verbier and then a lift and ski to the mont fort hut .
this was my post funk to chamonix shopping and the shake down for the haute route . <eos> 17km ski down the vallée blanche with what i call some ice canyoneering . <eos> my guide managed to keep us off the normal route as much as possible . <eos> we stayed high to hut during this bluebird day . <eos> powder , survival skiing , and ice fall treachery . <eos> certainly a rite of passage . <eos> i skied with < a href= '' http : //www.chamonix-guides.com/index.php ? langue=en & amp ; typesaison=1 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.chamonix-guides.com/index.php ? langue=en & amp ; typesaison=1 < /a > < a href= '' http : //vimeo.com/15451070 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vimeo.com/15451070 < /a >

bismarck , n.d. -- the 14th annual red ribbon carnival was held oct. 27 at the raymond j. bohn armory in bismarck . <eos> the north dakota national guard counterdrug program along with committee members from ndsu extension , police youth bureau , and the mandan police department hosted the event for area students of all ages and their parents . <eos> “ the purpose of the red ribbon carnival is to bring awareness of drug prevention to the community , ” said maj. jocelyn gallagher , a committee member from the north dakota national guard counterdrug drug demand reduction program . <eos> letters are sent out to surrounding schools from the committee inviting them to participate in the carnival . <eos> if a school decides to participate , they reply to the committee with an idea for a booth or fundraiser they would like to have at the carnival . <eos> the committee monitors the various types of booths and fundraisers to ensure a diverse educational and fun experience is provided . <eos> the carnival is not just a good resource for the children , though . <eos> parents are given a chance to discuss topics that would normally be harder to talk about . <eos> “ information presented at the carnival can spark conversations between parents and their children that might not otherwise come up , ” said staff sgt . <eos> melanie vincent , another committee member from the north dakota national guard counterdrug drug demand reduction program . <eos> “ it ’ s not just a parent lecturing their child , but the whole community helping the children to make good choices. ” “ adults get useful education too , such as knowledge about different resources that are available if they need help with a child who is abusing substances , ” added vincent . <eos> by creating an environment where being drug free is discussed in a fun , relaxed manner , the red ribbon carnival allows parents and children to discuss openly without the normal stresses associated with such conversations . <eos> “ red ribbon carnivals help keep the information about prevention out there while providing positive role models . <eos> it allows children to have fun with the whole family while becoming educated about the dangers of drugs , ” said gallagher . <eos> “ the community is very involved with the event through donations and the schools provide a lot of support . <eos> without the community and bismarck/mandan schools , the carnival wouldn ’ t be possible , ” said vincent .

although our built environment is not necessarily designed to facilitate our personal longings and desires , its spaces certainly enable us to court , fight , make love , get drunk , debate , urinate and walk our way back home from that embarrassing dinner date . <eos> taking his works still ( 2006 ) and the healers ( 2010 ) as a starting point , rotterdam-based artist tim leyendekker curates a program that focuses on films that deal with the western urban landscape as a witness to intimate social interactions and the de/reconstruction of the cinematic narrative . <eos> still by tim leyendekker netherlands , 1989 , 5 minutes , 16mm two kids make their first date through a telephone dating line . <eos> a piece on desire and memory . <eos> god provides by brian m. cassidy and melanie shatzky usa , 2006 , 9 minutes , digital projection shot in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina and bound by elements of fiction , this documentary short is a glimpse into faith-based sentiment and inexplicable loss in the american south . <eos> while a man searches for his kitchen appliances in the bushes , elsewhere a grinning preacher takes souvenir snapshots for his congregation , and a woman with a disability journeys to a quieter place . <eos> the truth machine by simone bennett netherlands , 2007 , 10 minutes , digital projection a short film about a car accident based on an old persian fable : truth is a mirror which fell to earth in a million pieces , and each human being picked up a piece , looked at it and saw themselves reflected . <eos> and each decided they saw the truth…but not realising that truth is splintered among all people . <eos> oral historyby volko kamensky germany , 2009 , 22 minutes , digital projection a report from the land of the brothers grimm : the story of a sleepy german hamlet presented in twenty-two images . <eos> the voices of its inhabitants guide the audience through the rural environment , but the impact of the film owes as much to what is concealed as to what is shown and said . <eos> the crucial distinction between story and history becomes increasingly flimsy . <eos> a necessary music by beatrice gibson and alex waterman usa , 2008 , 30 minutes , digital projection derived from texts by residents of roosevelt island , and bioy casares , a necessary music is a musically conceived science fiction film featuring robert ashley . <eos> the takes long , languid and beautifully pictorial C in a narration shared between robert ashley ( perhaps one of the most distinguished voices in contemporary music ) and dwellers of roosevelt island ( a small sliver of land situated between nyc burroughs manhattan and queens ) - a necessary music is a musically conceived science fiction film , exploring the social imaginary of a utopian landscape through directed attention to the voices that inhabit it . <eos> the healers by tim leyendekker netherlands , 2010 , 10 minutes , digital projection the healers is a deconstructive reconstruction of a memory set in early 90 ’ s nightlife . <eos> layers that normally form a cinematographic entity by merging together are stripped bare and served separately in order to provoke the boundaries of the constructed narrative . <eos> 66 scenes from america by jrgen leth denmark , 1982 , 42 minutes , digital projection as a visual narrative 66 scenes from america is reminiscent of a pile of postcards from a journey , which indeed is what the film is . <eos> it consists of a series of lengthy shots of tableaux nature , each appearing to be a random cross section of american reality , but which in total evoke a highly emblematic picture of the usa . <eos> a personal , subjective rendition , full of experiences and sensations , big and small . <eos> jim supanick is a videomaker and writer born in cleveland , oh , and now living in brooklyn . <eos> his work has been exhibited at museums , galleries , and festivals , including the cleveland museum of art , dia art foundation thomas erben gallery , la freewaves , and pdx festival , and has received funding from the new york state council on the arts , the experimental television center , and the puffin foundation . <eos> his current two-part project , seed sold back to the farmer , traces taylorism ’ s psychic impact over the course of the last 100-odd years . <eos> his essays have appeared in exhibition catalogs and publications such as film comment , millennium film journal , the wire , film international , cineaste , and the brooklyn rail . <eos> his writing has received support from the new york foundation for the arts and the creative capital/andy warhol art writers grant program . <eos> other writings can be viewed at his blog as a chimney draw
02/07/2013 - an eu civil protection exercise , eu taranis 2013 , held in salzburg , austria , was completed on saturday 29 june . <eos> the cooperation within and among the civil protection teams from austria , bulgaria , romania , croatia , the czech republic , the netherlands and germany was tested during this three day drill . <eos> emphasis was placed on how response capacities from other member states can be best integrated in a domestic emergency response during a major disaster . <eos> according to the scenario , austria was hit by heavy rains and the consequent flooding greatly damaged the infrastructure . <eos> this triggered road , train and plane accidents , some of which involved chemical spills . <eos> the teams practised urban search and rescue , search and rescue in chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( cbrn ) conditions , rescue in flood conditions , high capacity pumping , and water purification . <eos> photo /story credit : eu/ echo/ oerk < a href= '' http : //ec.europa.eu/echo/news/2013/20130701_en.htm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > ec.europa.eu/echo/news/2013/20130701_en.htm < /a >

photography by kevin gebhardt article by peter nickeas tribune reporter 1:13 a.m. cdt , september 9 , 2012 a two-year-old girl was airlifted to lutheran general hospital in park ridge after the car she was in was hit by an outbound metra train in elgin about 10 p.m. saturday , according to authorities . <eos> the car she was in was driven by her father , who police believe was intoxicated . <eos> the child 's five-year-old brother and pregnant mother were also in the car , though the toddler 's injuries were the most serious , elgin police commander glenn theriault said . <eos> police are also investigating whether the rain played a role in the accident , theriault said . <eos> the grade-level incident happened at ramond street , south and east of the national street station . <eos> the train demolished the front of the car , authorities said . <eos> & quot ; the motor was on the roadway , the transmission and parts were all over the place , & quot ; said elgin fire department battalion chief bryan mcmahan said . <eos> & quot ; all four were out of the vehicle , waiting in a passerby 's vehicle. & quot ; a second car coming the opposite way ran into the first car that was damaged , mcmahan said . <eos> it 's unclear whether the car tried to skirt the train gates or whether they were malfunctioning . <eos> train 2721 , which hit the car , was delayed by about 90 minutes because of the accident , metra spokesman tom miller said . <eos> inbound train 2724 from elgin toward chicago was cancelled because of the accident , according to the agency . <eos> pnickeas @ tribune.com twitter : @ peternickeas

& quot ; ... bienvenidos a ciudad hidalgo ... & quot ; is painted on a sign that everyday hundreds of central americans migrants will read as they cross the south border entering chiapas . <eos> they are just about to begin a 3000 miles journey accross mexico to the us border . <eos> the flow of central american immigrants bound for the united states has surged 25 % or more this year , say government and aid agency officials , who point to a sharp climb in deportations , injury reports and need for assistance as the basis for their estimates . <eos> confronted with increasingly bleak economies in their home countries and rising gang violence , the immigrants , many of them young , are heading north through mexico at a rate that mexican and honduran authorities agree has gone through the roof . <eos> one such immigrant is carlos alberto . <eos> the 18-year-old honduran was interviewed as he waited to hop the northbound chiapas-mayab railroad line here with about 200 other youths . <eos> neither police nor railroad officials made any apparent effort to stop them from hitching rides atop empty boxcars and fuel tankers . <eos> his goal : to earn money in florida and send it back to his mother . <eos> maría hermenegilda reyes was n't so lucky ! <eos> she is a 25 year old woman from san salvador.as i spoke to her at the shelter ¨jesús del buen pastor¨ , she closed her eyes , breathed deeply and turned her palms- hand asked : ¨ why , oh my lord ... why ? <eos> a shadow of sadness transformed her face . <eos> she looked at her amputated legs and shy tears appeared , as receiving an answer , on her eyes .

these are pictures of the aftermath of the crash we were in on the night of 12/18/06 , when a drunk driver slammed our car from the left and forced us into a ravine . <eos> we rolled several times and came to rest on the driver 's side . <eos> aside from some bruises and such , we 're both fine . <eos> these pictures were taken mostly by amber using the new camera she was supposed to be getting for christmas , but which i convinced her mom to give her early so we could take these pictures on our way home in the rental car . <eos> thanks , amy !

well , it was a surprise ! <eos> mark and i were supposed to meet at the storage unit , and three blocks from the house this guy did n't see the traffic to the west and drove right into my door . <eos> thankfully , the caprice was built like a tank . <eos> i 'm sorry to see it go ( which it likely will ) because it was reid 's car and one of the last 'tangible ' things i have to tie with him . <eos> i had a bit of a sore knuckle and a small cut on the back of my right hand , and one shoulder - the left one that hit the door or the door hit is - is a little sore . <eos> it 's been a great vehicle for about 3 years ... hope my next one is as good . <eos> this one made it to ohio and back twice !

why wearing your seatbelt is n't always good enough ( although i have no idea what condition the driver and/or passengers are in ) . <eos> this person struck a guardrail in exactly the wrong fashion , causing what is known as & quot ; guardrail impalement. & quot ; check out the drivers side where the guardrail folded in and then pushed into the car . <eos> this is common with impacts at the end of the guardrail at a slight angle . <eos> try not to do this . <eos> remember , guardrail is designed to protect you from something worse ( in this case a rollover ) but it 's still a very hard object to hit .

my 2007 ford fusion held up quite well when some knucklehead in a 1980 chevy pickup decided to go barreling through a red light at about 40 mph . <eos> i 'm fine , the car is driveable , and the guy who hit me ... well ... he had his truck towed and was taken to the hospital .
one of the worst accidents i 've seen in person . <eos> nine cars damaged , five of which were totaled on the spot . <eos> thankfully the human injuries were minimal for such an accident . <eos> the story : around 1am , the black lincoln ls sped up spruce street @ 100+ mph . <eos> after blowing a red light and swerving to avoid the cars that were crossing the intersection the driver lost control and plowed into two parked cars on the right hand side of the road ( mazda3 & amp ; a jetta ) and pushed them 40 feet onto the sidewalk in to a cement wall . <eos> the lincoln then spun and smashed into the two cars that were parked in front of the jetta , totaling one and damaging two others . <eos> the car continued another 500 feet up the hill crossing another intersection where it finally stopped by crashing into the front end of a taxi cab . <eos> the driver was ejected from his vehicle sometime during the first two collisions and flew a hundred plus feet where his body then collided with two cars , a street light and finally the pavement . <eos> amazingly , he was still alive ( technically speaking ) when the ambulance took him away . <eos> not sure of why the driver was going so fast on a residential road nor how the police were able to respond so quickly . <eos> between viewing some of the accident ( as it occured ) from my window , grabbing my phone , my jacket and running outside the police already arrived . <eos> new link : < a href= '' http : //abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story ? section=news/local & amp ; id=5887278 '' target= '' _blank '' rel= '' nofollow '' > abc local < /a >
sunday afternoon on january 20 , 2008 around 3:10pm , i was cruising down stark at a speed nearly matching traffic , but still had a car that wanted to pass me . <eos> as i neared 55th ave , i saw that a car traveling in the opposite direction was starting to turn left . <eos> there was at least 100 feet between the car ahead and me , but i do n't think this turning car had paid much attention to look for anything other than another car while turning . <eos> she made it through half her turn before deciding she was going to stop , all the while i 'm thinking and trying to slow down . <eos> if i went in front of her , i would have been run over as she was still moving . <eos> if i went to the left of her , i would have been in on-coming traffic and mostly likely hit . <eos> even as i braked , left a skidmark , and slammed into the passenger door , i could hear the car behind me come to screetching halt . <eos> i was fortunate enough to not be seriously hurt nor my bike at all damaged . <eos> the handlebars were slightly twisted but easly put back into place and a lid on a water bottle was shattered as it hit the ground . <eos> we exchanged information and i got her policy number . <eos> i took some pictures to document the scene . <eos> i even called my friend matt for some advice on what to do . <eos> i then called 911 to see if the police would come which the operator then informed me the popo would n't make an appearance . <eos> she was very apologetic and some witniesses made sure i was ok. soon , we were both on our way and i was spinning to the store . <eos> it 's been a few hours since the crash and i 've just a couple of scrapes , sore deltoid , and a sore thumb , but i think i 'll be ok and i 'm still kind of eager to get back onto the road .

1965 chrysler newport 2 door coupe , 1965 was a transition year for the chrysler newport , now exuding 60 's styling with its stainless recessed grill , quad headlamps and bold and sweeping side body lines . <eos> gorgeous in peacock turquoise two stage paint finish , the body having been completely stripped of its original paint , all chrome and stainless removed and refinished in a two stage process , at a documented cost of over $ 6,000.00 dollars , the paint is spectacular . <eos> a rust free car , with no previous accident history , and very nice original interior , you will not find a nicer low mile example of this model . <eos> some surface rust appears on the suspension which is normal . <eos> the newports tinted glass , stainless and chrome are in excellent condition , and all the windows function very nicely . <eos> powered by a 383 cubic inch ( 6.3 liter ) 270 h/p , five bolt main bearing , and 9.2:1 compression ratio v8 , it 's quite quick for a car weighing in at just over 4k pounds . <eos> torque is factory rated at 390 @ 2800 rpm . <eos> the engine starts immediately with no unusual noises , smoke or leaks . <eos> the transmission is a 727 torqueflite , followed by a 3.23 ratio differential . <eos> the newports previous owner , having owned it for many years replaced the rear leaf springs , rebuilt the front suspension , and installed dual exhaust with flow master mufflers . <eos> the newport is additionally equipped with power steering , and power brakes , the brakes which are more fitting to stop a train . <eos> all lights , heater , switches , controls , and gauges function as originally designed . <eos> the factory am transistor radio makes some strange noises when turned on , possibly messages from space , but does not function . <eos> a earlier vintage f/m radio with equalizer and some interesting pioneer speakers ( shown on the dash ) have been installed and work nicely . <eos> wheels and tires are 14 & quot ; and the tires are in very nice condition with an average tread depth of 6 to 7/32 inch . <eos> the newport retains is original and very nice condition hubcaps . <eos> in conclusion , the chryler newport coupe is a unique , very nice , low mileage representation of this year . <eos> it is virtually a & quot ; turn key & quot ; car which requires nothing , and can be driven almost anywhere . <eos> hemmings find of the day C 1965 chrysler newport l mar 4th , 2015

we came across this seemingly abandoned church on the side of road 200 in vieques . <eos> i have since learned that this is likely la capilla ecumenica ( the ecumenical chapel ) that became the spiritual center of the movement to remove the navy from vieques . <eos> the chapel was destroyed by the government after religious leaders occupied it in 2000 , but was rebuilt two years later in san juan with the original church bell . <eos> the rebuilt chapel was then moved back to the island in 2003 for use in the transition ceremony after the navy agreed to leave . <eos> you can read more < a href= '' http : //books.google.com/books ? id=nbasmuzh71oc & amp ; pg=pa75 & amp ; lpg=pa75 & amp ; dq=ecumenical+church , +road+200 , +vieques & amp ; source=bl & amp ; ots=v6grd0fk9s & amp ; sig=gpg2cswr99esoev0tuibhvchkk4 & amp ; hl=en & amp ; ei=p7nxs6dwdpcw8abqlpjfcw & amp ; sa=x & amp ; oi=book_result & amp ; ct=result & amp ; resnum=1 & amp ; ved=0cacq6aewaa # v=onepage & amp ; q= & amp ; f=false '' rel= '' nofollow '' > here < /a > , if you 're interested .

bomberos uruguayos trabajan el miércoles en la liberación de los dos cuerpos que quedaron atrapados en el avión privado argentino que cayó el martes al río de la plata , provocando la muerte de cinco de las nueve personas que viajaban en él , informó a la afp el vocero del organismo . <eos> la jueza penal de carmelo , alexandra facal , & quot ; dispuso que bomberos sea convocado para liberar los cuerpos atrapados & quot ; en el fuselaje del avión , dijo a la afp el comisario leandro palomeque , jefe de relaciones públicas de la dirección nacional de bomberos . <eos> & quot ; dos bomberos con material de rescate están arribando al lugar & quot ; . <eos> el accidente tuvo lugar a unos 10 kilómetros al sur de carmelo ( suroeste de uruguay ) , en una zona de islotes y donde el río tiene profundidad , lo que dificulta el acceso al lugar de las embarcaciones . <eos> el avión -un bimotor privado de matrícula argentina lv-cnt , modelo beechcraft 200 , a bordo del cual viajaban un piloto y ocho pasajeros , todos argentinos- viajaba al mediodía del martes desde la localidad argentina de san fernando a carmelo , en un vuelo que lleva entre 15 y 20 minutos , cuando cayó al río por causas que aún se desconocen . <eos> una hora después , la fuerza aérea uruguaya y la prefectura naval argentina rescataron a los cuatro sobrevivientes , dos de los cuales fueron trasladados a san fernando y los más graves a centros médicos de colonia . <eos> las víctimas fatales del accidente son el piloto leandro larriera , de 43 aos , y cuatro ejecutivos de empresas : gustavo fosco ( 45 ) y fernando sánchez ( 37 ) , de renault argentina ; fernando lonigro ( 44 ) , de tts viajes ; y facundo alecha ( 40 ) , consultor en recursos humanos . <eos> en colonia fueron hospitalizados & quot ; con heridas de consideración & quot ; según el informe de la fuerza aérea uruguaya , paula buery , de 39 aos y también integrante de tts viajes , y sebastián vivona ( 43 ) , gerente de ventas de la empresa de vestimenta kosiuko . <eos> los dos sobrevivientes trasladados al hospital de san fernando -ignacio llosa ( 34 ) y santiago villamil ( 37 ) - sufrieron politraumatismos leves y se & quot ; encuentran fuera de peligro & quot ; , informó el martes el ministerio de salud de la provincia de buenos aires .

when christmas rolled around last year , we told our son , < a href= '' http : //www.knewtonblog.com/2009/12/10/adaptive-learning-and-traffic-lights/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > david < /a > , that there was no need for him to spend any money on presents for us - we already have all of the toys and gadgets that we need , and we know that he 's on a tight budget ( otherwise , i might have asked for an aston martin , or a diamond-studded apple ipad , or perhaps a private jet ) . <eos> david responded with several creative ideas , one of which was an offer to cook a & quot ; decadent meal & quot ; for us . <eos> we accepted happily , and he arrived in our apartment on tuesday evening and promptly set about whipping together a wonderful presentation of bucatini all'amatriciana -- which , i have been asked to emphasize , substituted traditional spaghetii in place of the bucatini pasta called for in the < a href= '' http : //www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/161irex.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > official recipe < /a > . <eos> my wife had shopped for most of the ingredients , and done a little chopping and basic preparation ; and i contributed to the meal by stopping at the local liquor store to find a good bottle of italian barolo wine . <eos> since i have no culinary skills whatsoever , common sense dictated that i stay out of the kitchen , safely away from the people doing the & quot ; serious & quot ; work of preparing the meal . <eos> but i could n't help sticking my camera into the middle of things from time to time , and i ended up with this set of photos ... by the way , if you want to recreate this yourself , check out < a href= '' http : //www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/161irex.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > recipe : bucatini all ’ amatriciana < /a > in the january 16 , 2008 issue of the < i > new york times. < /i >

food for chinese new year and v-day .
03.13.05 suzun invited us over to this mansion ( by nyc standards ) in harlem where she was house/dog/cat sitting and served us a lovely dinner w/ a side of some mexican train action .
all dishes were prepared by nick and i ( with the exception of dessert , made by clementine ) .
i 'm visiting my parents ' place for chistmas at the moment , so i had a pretty relaxing dilo day ; i did n't take nearly as many photos as last time . <eos> having the & quot ; food & quot ; theme was good , as it gave me something to focus on , even when being lazy . <eos> : ) also spare a thought for my mum , who went into hospital yesterday with a rather nasty migraine -- it 's nothing serious , no emergency except that she was in a lot of pain , and obviously i did n't photograph it because no one wants photographs of themselves when they 're sick , and i did n't make the trip to the hospital myself . <eos> and an update on that situation -- it turns out that things are a bit worse than they originally thought , and she will be flown to sydney for additional tests . <eos> at the moment she 's not in immediate danger , but it 's still scary .
gastrocast # 26 is about value for money -- inexpensive country spareribs served in a more elegant fashion . <eos> for more information about the podcast , please check out < a href= '' http : //podchef.motime.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > podchef.motime.com < /a >

peter prepared a sumptuous french-inspired thanksgiving dinner spread for his parents and me . <eos> for appetizers , we started with tomato w/ mozerella cheese in olive oil and balsamic vinegar , as well as an irresistibly rich garlic broth . <eos> for the entree , the seasoned turkey from the oven cooked to perfection . <eos> sides included bread stuff , garlic mash potato , and caramelized carrots . <eos> finally for dessert , home-made vanilla creme brulee topped with fresh raspberries !
leftover turkey can turn into something more than mundane -- turkey pasties ! <eos> great for a party , or portable lunches , the traditional cornish pasty does great with this new twist . <eos> for more information , please visit < a href= '' http : //podchef.motime.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > podchef.motime.com < /a >

st. patrick 's day dublin 2010. in the thirteen years since i 've been away from ireland the demographic has changed , reflected in the numbers of foreign born who have made it their home and adopted its customs and enjoy the culture . <eos> my theme in these pictures is to show the diversity that has transformed ireland during the celtic tiger years ( and still does despite the financial crash of the economy ) . <eos> today the financial woe is forgotten as the streets are filled with a wide selection of faces , having fun .

ocs is like boot camp but with more running and less yelling . <eos> while boot camp is 13 weeks and ocs is only 10 , almost all of us were limping across the parade deck on graduation day . <eos> so , i do n't think we could have lasted much longer .

i ’ m not sure whether there are any human remains under these 23 hectares of neatly clipped lawn .. the < a href= '' ” '' rel= '' nofollow '' > official us website < /a > describing this cemetery seems to suggest that the soldiers were disinterred in 1947 and reburied in the us . <eos> be that as it may , there are 7992 crosses and stars of david ( no crescent moons that i saw ) arranged in severe swooping lines in this tranquil space 3km north west of henri-chapelle . <eos> by october 1944 , the us 12th army group had swept from normandy to the rhine , driving a demoralised , under-equipped and confused wehrmacht from one retreat to another . <eos> but the us army ran out of supplies , while the german army reorganised and substantially hardened its resistance . <eos> the allies ’ headlong rush stuttered and stalled in increasingly unfavourable weather , but by november supplies were sufficiently satisfactory for general eisenhower to order lt. gens . <eos> omar bradley and george patton to renew the attack . <eos> patton thrust with his characteristic aggression toward the saar . <eos> equally in character , bradley held his line in the ardennes , trusting to the terrain to discourage his enemy . <eos> apparently he had not completely absorbed the lesson that guderian had dealt the french and british four years earlier , when his tanks and troops had blitzed through this very area , shattering the allied front and forcing the collapse of france and the british debacle at dunkirk . <eos> sit tight and recuperate ? <eos> bad idea . <eos> at dawn on a foggy 16th december the wehrmacht smashed through bradley ’ s lines with a massive counteroffensive . <eos> a devastating surprise , it confused and dismayed the allies , stopped their offensive in its tracks , and cost 70,000 allied dead C as frequently from exposure as battle C as they reeled under the onslaught . <eos> hitler had infiltrated the front with english-speaking soldiers in us uniforms , whose job was to cut communications , misdirect traffic , and sabotage whatever they could . <eos> in the midst of a great snowstorm , an intense 2-hour bombardment preceded the thrust of tanks and troops in white camouflage . <eos> the storm lasted a week , and nullified the allied command of the air . <eos> fair weather followed , and without air cover , and in the face of rapidly stiffening resistance , von runstedt and model ’ s troubles intensified . <eos> the 6th panzer army found itself held up , and after 4 days of clear weather , patton 's tanks relieved the beleaguered bastogne , and the offensive had failed . <eos> two other incidents are worth recording . <eos> the luftwaffe launched the first jet bomber attack in history on christmas day . <eos> the 16 aircraft attacked ciege , damaging a ball-bearing factory , a tool-die warehouse and railway yards . <eos> during the assault , ss-obersturmbannfuehrer < a href= '' ” '' rel= '' nofollow '' > joachim peiper < /a > ’ s unit captured an american motor convoy of battery b of the 285th field artillery observation battalion near malmedy . <eos> following the common practice in russia , where he had won the ritterkreuz and commanded the leibstandarte 's armored regiment , he led the men into a field and machine-gunned them , killing 72. about 30 survived the massacre . <eos> in 1946 he was sentenced to death , but the sentence was never carried out . <eos> peiper was not a good man .

waited until the very last second to decide whether to go to jay peak , mount st anne or le massif ( charlevoix / baie saint paul near quebec city ) based on who was likely to get the most snow for the easter weekend 2007. arrived to a mostly empty hill , 93cm of fresh powder and gorgeous conditions for 2 solid days . <eos> second day the hill groomed only one side of half the runs so it was soft powder moguls . <eos> the best day of the year for me ! ! <eos> spent easter monday at saint anne and they received on a fraction of the snow in comparison .

companies making products or providing services for consumers issued trade cards to advertise and promote the sale of their goods or services . <eos> usually available to consumers through various retail stores , trade cards also could be obtained as a premium enclosed with products ( for example , bread , coffee , cigarettes ) . <eos> usually these cards display seller or product name and a pictorial representation of the service or product , although the image may be unrelated to the product . <eos> the earliest trade cards began to be distributed in the late 1700s in london , england . <eos> in the united states , as lithographic technology improved during the 1870s and 1880s , beautiful full-color trade cards began to be produced . <eos> their popularity as an advertising medium continued through the 1890s then declined until the early 1900s when the trade cards were replaced by color advertising in periodicals . <eos> see also , pic of the month for may 1996 “ d.m . <eos> ferry & amp ; co. trade card ” on the henry ford website , < a href= '' http : //www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/1996/96.may.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/1996/96.may.html < /a > for more information about these images or other collections of the henry ford , contact research.center @ thehenryford.org .

rochedale state school
we celebrated easter in the presidio a couple of years ago and as imagined , it got a bit out of control . <eos> the easter bunny got a wee bit drunk and decided that double fisting beers , smoking cigarettes , and waving to families coming home from church was the only appropriate thing to do . <eos> this was quickly followed by the bunny tackling the person named christian , as it was easter . <eos> and finally , the chicken decided that he had enough of the bunny 's shit .

we went to my cousin 's wedding in llanelli , stopping off in the forest of dean to see jon 's dad on the way back .
coastal drive to st. andrews
home , and also at duke gardens .
it is n't easy to get to , but easter island is well worth the trip . <eos> mataveri airport is the most remote airport on earth with regularly scheduled service . <eos> the island itself is rugged and parched , but beautiful . <eos> aside from the iconic moai , there are simply stunning views to be had at orongo crater and rano raraku . <eos> wild horses roam most of the island , and can turn up just about anywhere ( as they did at rano raraku 's crater as we were hiking through ) . <eos> with rocky shores , there are only two beaches on the entire island - with only one of them ( anakena ) fit for swimming . <eos> ovahe beach is prone to rip-tides and rock-slides , but makes for beautiful photos . <eos> although it is the only real beach for thousands of miles , anakena is idyllic . <eos> we enjoyed spending most of an afternoon soaking in the ( surprisingly cool ) south pacific waters . <eos> the island itself is also very laid back - at least to tourists . <eos> there is an element of hostility between the native islanders and the chilean government . <eos> we witnessed several protests during our stay , complaining of mistreatment of islanders by the chilean authorities . <eos> as we walked by , the protesters urged us to photograph them , and to let people know that the chilean government was disrespectful of the rights of native islanders in favor of foreign or chilean developers . <eos> it would be sad to see the current , laid-back atmosphere of easter island changed by large resort developments . <eos> the place currently has an & quot ; untouched & quot ; feel that is simply relaxing , and having an iberostar or riu all-inclusive pop up somewhere on the island would pretty much ruin it , in my opinion . <eos> hopefully that sort of thing wo n't happen . <eos> with its remoteness , and the fact that much of the island is a national park , i 'd like to think that easter island will remain a niche destination , without the sort of excess development that has mctraveled so much of the world .

hello 2010 go have adventures i ’ m not much of a resolutions kind of person . <eos> honestly i don ’ t think that i ’ ve ever kept a single new year ’ s resolution of mine . <eos> however , i ’ ve realized many of the dreams that i write down at the start of a new years have come true , so i am a big believer of writing down my dreams . <eos> also as a yoga-practitioner , having a mantra does make sense to meC a phrase to repeat over and over , to give me resolve and focus . <eos> if i reflect on the areas of my life that need improvement , i think that what i would like most of all is more courage . <eos> in this year what i ’ d like to remind myself is to go have adventures ! <eos> and to always pick the choice that makes for a better story . <eos> happy 2010 ! <eos> here ’ s a new year ’ s eve kiss from mississippi xx

january 16th 2010 was the 24th consecutive month of peaceful global protests againt the scientology cult . <eos> clearwater anons went with a 2nd & quot ; anoniversary & quot ; theme to celebrate the 2nd aniversary of the start of project chanology . <eos> it was two years ago this month that the now famous tom cruise video was leaked on the internet , which the scientology cult then tried to suppress . <eos> as a result critical thinkers around the globe did their homework and rose up as one to say & quot ; do not want ! & quot ; within a month that online activism had evolved to include protests outside scientology centers around the world . <eos> all faces of those unmasked are blurred to protect them from the cult 's & quot ; fair game & quot ; policy of harassing it 's critics . <eos> < b > these are brave people of all ages and walks of life , standing shoulder to shoulder with ex-scientologists to bring the truth < u > to you < /u > < /b > . <eos> but do n't take my word for it , < b > < u > educate yourself < /u > about what < a href= '' http : //www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865,00.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > time magazine < /a > called & quot ; the cult of greed and power & quot ; : < /b > < a href= '' http : //www.whyweprotest.net '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.whyweprotest.net < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.xenu.net '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.xenu.net < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.exscientologykids.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.exscientologykids.com < /a >

andré the giant more at imdbpro  ad feedbackdate of birth 19 june 1946 , molien , france date of death 27 january 1993 , paris , france ( heart failure ) birth name andré rené roussimoff nickname the 8th wonder of the world the giant the gentle giant the french giant height 7 ' ( 2.13 m ) mini biography andré rené roussimoff was born in a small farming community in grenoble , france to boris and marian rouismoff . <eos> his parents and four siblings were all of normal size , but andré suffered from acromegaly , a hormonal disorder that results when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone . <eos> as the giant grew up ( very quickly , as he reached the height of 6 ' 3 & quot ; by the age of 12 ) he began to often disagree with his parents . <eos> he left home at 14 and obtained a job with a furniture-moving firm and began to play rugby . <eos> at 17 he was seen training at a gym by several professional wrestlers . <eos> impressed by his size , they taught him some basic wrestling skills and built a friendship with him . <eos> later , when one of the wrestlers was injured , andré stepped in for him . <eos> he would wrestle for nearly thirty more years . <eos> by his early 20s andré had wrestled in algeria , south africa , morocco , tunisia , england , scotland , and most of non-communist europe but had not found fame . <eos> in 1971 he came to north america under the name jean ferre and was mildly popular in canada . <eos> then he met a new york based booker by the name of vincent j. mcmahon ( often incorrectly referred to as & quot ; vince mcmahon sr & quot ; ) who renamed him & quot ; andre the giant , & quot ; and billed him as 7 ' 4 & quot ; ( andre was really closer to 7 ' ) . <eos> soon andre the giant became a national sensation and was a much sought after wrestler . <eos> in addition he participated in television , movies , and commercials . <eos> with his wealth the giant bought a ranch in ellerbe , north carolina where he would live during his rare time off and after he retired from wrestling in 1990. he died while in france after attending his father 's funeral . <eos> andré was cremated and his ashes were spread across his ranch . <eos> he is survived by his one daughter . <eos> imdb mini biography by : j.w . <eos> braun mini biography when andre the giant challenged hulk hogan for the wwf world 's heavyweight wrestling championship of the world at wrestlemania iii in 1987 , he had n't lost a single 's match since 1971. his 3,000 plus winning streak was ended when hogan picked up the 7 foot tall and 500 pound giant and body slammed him for the pin . <eos> over 94,000 fans viewed this history making match-up , setting an indoor record which still stands today . <eos> andre also defeated heavyweight boxing contender chuck wepner in a wrestler vs. boxer match on the under-card of the muhammad ali/antonio inoki challenge match in japan . <eos> the 6 feet 6 inch . <eos> wepner was thrown completely out of the ring . <eos> imdb mini biography by : angelsunchained trade mark trademark move : bearhug trademark move : headbutt trademark move : choke trademark move : big splash trademark move : elbow drop trademark move : double underhook suplex trademark move : tombstone piledriver trademark move : big boot trademark move : knife-edged chops enormous stature and frame towering height trivia former wwf tag team champion w/ haku . <eos> appeared at the first 6 wrestlemanias . <eos> wrestlemania ( 1985 ) ( v ) beat big john studd in a bodyslam match . <eos> wrestlemania 2 ( 1986 ) ( v ) : won a wwf/nfl battle royal . <eos> wrestlemania iii ( 1987 ) ( v ) : lost to hulk hogan ( event set an indoor attendance record that still stands ) . <eos> wrestlemania iv ( 1988 ) ( v ) : received bye in round 1 of tournament , fought to a double dq with hulk hogan in round 2. wrestlemania vi ( 1990 ) ( v ) : lost tag team titles with tonga fifita ( a.k.a . <eos> haku ) to bill eadie and barry darsow ( a.k.a . <eos> demolition ) . <eos> andré suffered from acromegaly , in which the body does n't stop secreting growth hormone . <eos> professional wrestler weighed about 520 lbs at time of death , was in paris to attend his father 's funeral . <eos> lost a few inches of height because of a back surgery in the mid-1980s , but still stood about 6 ' 10 & quot ;

heel & quot ; in 1987 in time for his wrestlemania iii ( 1987 ) ( v ) match vs. hulk hogan . <eos> he turned good again after wrestlemania vi ( 1990 ) ( v ) , after bobby heenan blamed the giant for losing the wwf tag team belts he and tonga fifita ( a.k.a . <eos> haku ) held to bill eadie and barry darsow ( a.k.a . <eos> demolition ) . <eos> after pinning hulk hogan ( even though & quot ; the hulkster & quot ; clearly had his left shoulder raised ) and being awarded the wwf world championship belt , andre & quot ; surrendered & quot ; it immediately to ted dibiase ( who , in a storyline , was said to have paid andre to give him the belt , should he win it ) ; dibiase previously had tried , without success , to either win or purchase hogan 's title . <eos> andre 's 1988 match vs. hulk hogan for the wwf world championship , which he won in controversial fashion , was the 1988 pro wrestling illustrated & quot ; match of the year. & quot ; the match , which took place in indianapolis , was part of the first professional wrestling program to air in prime-time since the mid-'50s . <eos> andre 's most bitter feud began in 1983 , against big john studd ( who claimed he , not andre , was the true & quot ; giant & quot ; of wrestling ) . <eos> the feud included a series of bodyslam matches ( including one at wrestlemania ( 1985 ) ( v ) , where studd had to pay $ 10,000 ( later , $ 15,000 ) to anyone who could bodyslam him . <eos> made his last wwf appearance in 1991 at summerslam ( 1991 ) ( v ) , as a second to the bushwhackers in their match against the 'natural disasters ' . <eos> one of andre 's most memorable feuds was in 1981 vs. killer khan . <eos> the feud exploded after a may 2 match , wherein khan ( who had cheated throughout the match ) broke andre 's knee by leaping on it . <eos> nearly four months later , andre returned and demanded a rematch vs. khan ... and got it . <eos> he beat khan so badly the mongolian superstar had to be carried from the ring on a stretcher . <eos> andre also won a series of & quot ; stretcher & quot ; matches against khan in the fall of 1981. appeared in wrestlemania vii ( 1991 ) ( v ) in the corner of the big bossman when he took on curt hennig ( aka mr. perfect ) for the intercontinental championship . <eos> contrary to popular belief , killer khan did n't break andre 's leg . <eos> andre actually got out of bed one day , and his leg snapped due to his life-threatening illness . <eos> he was out for weeks , and the story was that killer khan did it , to hype up their feud . <eos> had a very close friendship with wwe referee tim white . <eos> sole survivor of the 1987 wwf survivor series main event , which pitted himself , king kong bundy , & quot ; ravishing & quot ; rick rude , george gray ( aka one man gang ) and & quot ; the natural & quot ; butch reed against the team of hulk hogan , ken patera , & quot ; mr. wonderful & quot ; paul orndorff , & quot ; the rock & quot ; don muraco and 'scott 'bam bam ' bigelow ' in an elimination match . <eos> he pinned bigelow to win the match . <eos> was an expert card player and collector of fine wines . <eos> was a close friend of bobby heenan ( aka & quot ;

( tri-state ) tag titles with dusty rhodes ; florida tag titles with rhodes ; wwf heavyweight title ; wwf tag team titles ( with tonga fifita , aka haku ) . <eos> washington redskins head coach george allen once offered andre a contract to play professional football . <eos> he would not commonly address people by their names , instead , if he liked someone he would call them & quot ; boss & quot ; . <eos> it was n't until he was an adult , on a wrestling tour of japan , that he went to see doctors to determine the cause of his condition . <eos> the japanese doctors diagnosed the cause as acromegaly , a rare condition in which victims are not expected to live beyond the age of 40. andre lived to be 46. godfather of bill eadie 's daughter . <eos> andre was defeated by jerry lawler ( aka & quot ; the king & quot ; ) in a match circa 1975. lawler had caused andre to be knocked from the ring , and andre was unable to answer the ten-count , thus giving rise to the infamous story & quot ; the night andre the giant lost to a midget ! & quot ; . <eos> he weighed 530 pounds at the time of his death . <eos> because of his size , he had a custom built recliner in his home that he always sat in when he was not on the road . <eos> as a child , his next-door neighbor was samuel beckett . <eos> inducted into the professional wrestling hall of fame in 2002 ( charter class ) . <eos> previous managers : bobby heenan , ted dibiase , frank valois , lou albano , ky wakamatsu , tim white . <eos> former world tag team champion . <eos> actually signed all his personal checks , & quot ; andre the giant & quot ; . <eos> andre continued to compete in tag team matches , primarily in japan and mexico , until the end of 1992. wrestlemania v ( 1989 ) ( tv ) : lost by dq to jake roberts ( aka jake & quot ; the snake & quot ; roberts ) . <eos> billy crystal was inspired to write the script to the movie my giant ( 1998 ) from having worked with 'andre the giant ' in the the princess bride ( 1987 ) . <eos> former nwa tri-state tag team champion . <eos> was considered for the role of jaws in the spy who loved me ( 1977 ) . <eos> mentioned in the 1974 guinness book of world records as the highest paid wrestler in history , up to that time . <eos> he earned $ 400,000 in one year alone during the early 1970s . <eos> daughter is robin christiansen who was born in 1979. her mother is jean christiansen of the seattle , washington area . <eos> samuel beckett , his neighbor , used to drive him to school . <eos> in 1965 , andre the giant received a draft notice for french 's peace time army , but was unable to join as there were no shoes big enough , bunks long enough , or trenches deep enough to accommodate him . <eos> nfl legend ernie holmes got hot-headed backstage at a wwe taping in 1986. andre the giant muttered to him , & quot ; you know , you talk too much , & quot ; and holmes never said a peep after that . <eos> according to two people in the van when it happened ( it was a rehearsal for the battle royal at wrestlemania ii ) , holmes was talking about how tough he was , and andre got tired of hearing about it . <eos> one time in the early 1980s during an early stint bad news brown had with wwe , the wrestlers were all on a bus traveling between shows . <eos> a very drunk andre the giant was in the back of the bus with hulk hogan and company telling racist jokes that bad news brown took offense to . <eos> bad news brown stood up , and yelled for him to shut up , then when he turned around , andre cursed at him . <eos> bad news brown had the driver stop the bus , and told andre to meet him outside . <eos> andre refused , and hogan , and others tried to soothe the situation . <eos> the next day andre apologized to bad news brown . <eos> bad news brown later admitted he was glad nothing ever happened because he believed andre could have really hurt him . <eos> in the mid 1970s , four men were hassling andre at a bar and he got angry and decided to so something about so he chased the guys out of the bar . <eos> they got in their car and thought they were safe . <eos> they were wrong . <eos> andre proceeded to roll the car on to its roof and then left . <eos> from bobby heenan 's book : andre had a bad habit of never buttoning his shirt in public places . <eos> one day , andre and the brain were in a small country and western bar , when andre had refused to button his shirt . <eos> a bouncer demanded that andre button his shirt . <eos> andre remained silent and continued to drink . <eos> the manager called the police . <eos> the officer that arrived reminded heenan of barney fife from the andy griffith show . <eos> & quot ; barney & quot ; told andre to button his shirt . <eos> andre still drank quietly . <eos> & quot ; barney & quot ; called for backup . <eos> & quot ; barney & quot ; asked that andre button his shirt again when several officers came in to backup & quot ; barney. & quot ; andre stood up , and & quot ; barney & quot ; realized that it was just too hot to be indoors . <eos> despite his character fezzik 's almost-superhuman strength in the princess bride , andre the giant 's back problems at the time prevented him from actually lifting anything heavy . <eos> robin wright penn had to be attached to wires in the scene where buttercup jumps from the castle window into fezzik 's arms because he could n't support her himself . <eos> according to author william goldman , when he was first trying to get the princess bride made in the 1970s , a then-unknown arnold schwarzenegger wanted to play fezzik , and he was strongly being considered because goldman could never get his first choice , andre the giant to read for the role . <eos> by the time the movie was made about twelve years later , arnold was such a big star they could not afford him , and andre was cast after all , and the two big men had gone on to become friends . <eos> during the filming of some scenes for the princess bride , the weather became markedly cold for robin wright penn . <eos> andre the giant helped her by placing one of his hands over her head ; his hands were so large that one would entirely cover the top of her head , keeping her warm . <eos> enjoyed playing card games such as cribbage and gin rummy . <eos> was a fan of & quot ; wheel of fortune & quot ; ( 1983 ) . <eos> is referenced in the eminem song 'crack a bottle '

” the storyslam aims to give those eager storytellers a forum , and also to encourage folks who ’ ve doubted they had a story worth telling . <eos> the moth storyslam provides a stage and a microphone , a theme to inspire and shape the evening , a lively and supportive audience , and a host to guide the festivities . <eos> slam stories are limited to five minutes , and ten stories are heard . <eos> the stories are scored by three teams of audience-member judges , and a winner is announced at every slam . <eos> the winners later face off in a moth grandslam . <eos> since 2001 , the raucous , moving , funny and wild stories that emerge during each show have kept the crowds coming back again and again . <eos> now , each month , there are four moth storyslams in nyc , three in los angeles and one in both detroit and chicago . <eos> the moth will add more cities in 2011. stories from the storyslams are regularly featured on the moth radio hour , which airs in over 200 major markets in america . <eos> jenifer hixson is senior producer at the moth , where she developed and oversees the moth storyslam . <eos> she rarely misses a storyslam meaning she ’ s heard approximately 2,890 five-minute stories . <eos> story-wise , there are always laughs , usually a tear or two , and on occasion , blood . <eos> great that after all this time , and all those stories , there are still surprises . <eos> standard issues is a monthly show which is designed for veteran storytellers to try out new material and new storytellers to get their feet wet in a fun and welcoming atmosphere . <eos> every third tuesday , at 8 o ’ clock at pacific standard in park slope , you can see new york ’ s acknowledged best together with the up and comers who are making a splash and then drink with them . <eos> then at the end of each show , the name of a mystery guest is pulled from the hat . <eos> cyndi freeman is an actress , playwright and burlesque performer . <eos> she co-produces the standard issues story telling show in brooklyn with her husband brad lawrence . <eos> she is a mothslam winner and has appeared on story telling shows throughout new york , including the liar show , stripped stories , true tales of college as well as others . <eos> she also performs burlesque as cherry pitz and produces hotsy totsy burlesque with co-producer joe the shark . <eos> she is currently working on a solo show entitled wonder woman : a how to guide for little jewish girls . <eos> told is a monthly storytelling show hosted by seth lind and produced by heidi grumelot . <eos> the third monday of every month , new york ’ s best performers take the stage at horse trade ’ s under st. mark ’ s theater to tell true stories related to a central theme . <eos> a special guest provides interludes to glue the evening together into a collective experience . <eos> seth lind hosts the monthly storytelling show told , performs improv comedy with the group thank you robot , and is production manager for the public radio program this american life . <eos> he ’ s also worked in various capacities on several documentaries and fiction films . <eos> seth has a pacemaker but no known allergies . <eos> brad lawrence , the curator of this evening , is one of new york city ’ s rising talents in the burgeoning world of live storytelling . <eos> a moth storyslam winner , and one of the few to achieve that distinction on his first appearance , he is also the only storyteller to win back to back moth grandslams . <eos> he has also been a guest intro performer for the moth ’ s outreach program to schools and institutional communities . <eos> he is a regular at such shows as the liar ’ s show , speakeasy stories , seth lind ’ s told , the risk podcast , as well as how i learned at happy endings and the show he co-produces with his wife , the standard issues , both of which have garnered him mentions in the new york times . <eos> brad is currently working on his memoir , monsters in the wood , and will be performing each chapter as a live show at under saint marks theater , beginning in november . <eos> his blog is billyjoesboy.com .

an easy sign that your hometown is shrinking is when all the schools start closing . <eos> june 2005 marked the closing of my elementary school , so i decided to give the place one last visit , two days after it closed its doors for good . <eos> < a target= '' _top '' href= '' http : //www.lhbe.edu.on.ca/oliver/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > oliver road public school , 1950-2005 < /a > .
this weekend scotland outdoors winners chris and rob arrived in shieldaig . <eos> after a comfortable evening at kinloch with richard and claire they headed up beinn damh with jim . <eos> rather than just have a 'zipped up jacket day ' dealing with the weather they opted to also have some instruction on basic ropework and navigation . <eos> the buttress leading up to sgurr na bana mhoraire provides an ideal environment to work at route-finding , direct belays and waist belays on classic summer ml terrain . <eos> we were rewarded with some glimpses of the surrounding torridon mountains when we reached the trig point at 867m . <eos> young and fit it did not take chris and rob long to reach the cairn shelter at the south end of the mountain . <eos> the final leg across the corrie to the true summit of 903m provided an excellent opportunity for some mountain navigation . <eos> after some discussion about the strength of the wind compared to that forecast we decided to head back towards torridon . <eos> instead of descending to the road and then trudging back up to the car we traversed north west back to our start point . <eos> on the way we were treated to the majestic sight of some hinds and attendant stags . <eos> just the ending to a pretty perfect day - well done guys ! <eos> jim sutherland < a href= '' http : //www.nineonesix.co.uk '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.nineonesix.co.uk < /a >

army fmwr director praises king ’ s “ soul generated by love. ” photo by rob dozier story by rob dozier u.s. army installation management command public affairs fort sam houston ( jan. 12 , 2012 ) -- & quot ; you only need a heart full of grace , and a soul generated by love , & quot ; dr. martin luther king jr. said in a sermon feb. 4 , 1968. king meant to encourage his congregation to seek greatness through service . <eos> j.c. abney , director of g9 , family and morale , welfare and recreation for the u.s. army installation management command , repeated king ’ s call to service as the featured speaker at the installation dr. martin luther king , jr. birthday celebration at fort sam houston theatre , jan 12 . <eos> “ we ’ re here to join and celebrate the legacy of a great man , dr. martin luther king , jr. , ” said abney . <eos> king is known for his work in the civil rights movement and his famous & quot ; i have a dream & quot ; speech . <eos> “ if he was still alive today , dr. king would be 83 years old , ” said abney . <eos> “ but at the time he spoke these words that represented his vision of an america rid of racial tension , he was only 34 years old. ” time won ’ t erase king ’ s call to selfless service . <eos> “ each and every time i hear that speech , the words resonate with me , especially when i think about the young dr. martin luther king , jr. ” said abney . <eos> ” no matter how you look at dr. king ’ s life , it is clear he lived a life of service. ” king ’ s short life is well documented . <eos> he graduated from high school at 15 , became an ordained minister and finished college at 19 , led his first church at 25 , earned a ph.d. at 26 , was a nobel peace prize laureate at 30 , and died at 39. abney stressed to the audience of about 250 that dr. king lived a life of service . <eos> & quot ; i have often heard people talk about life in terms of the dash , & quot ; said abney . <eos> & quot ; as you walk through a cemetery , and read the headstones , there is a dash that separates the date you are born and the date you die . <eos> dr. king 's dash was 39 years. & quot ; “ have you ever stopped to think what he accomplished in just those 39 years , as they relate to selfless service , ” abney questioned . <eos> “ have you ever stopped to think what your dash will tell others about your selfless service ? ” the birthday celebration was organized by the fort sam houston equal opportunity community to remember dr. king ’ s life and inspire soldiers and civilians to act . <eos> “ sometimes you have to respond to the call of service no matter where you are. ” said abney . <eos> king ’ s call to service came after rosa parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in montgomery , ala. , and was arrested . <eos> king responded by organizing the montgomery bus boycott . <eos> this action led to a supreme court decision that montgomery ’ s segregated buses were unconstitutional . <eos> “ courage is all that separates an ordinary person from a great person , ” said abney . <eos> “ but dr. king makes the point that when people serve , anybody can be great , because anybody can serve. ” abney ’ s speech was interrupted once by laughter at an opening joke and once again by applause for a recital of king ’ s famous speech by sgt . <eos> 1st class ahmand brown , 106th signal brigade . <eos> but for most of the 20-minute talk , the fort sam houston theatre was as quiet as a church . <eos> “ since his assassination in 1968 , dr. king ’ s legacy has inspired public service , ” said abney . <eos> “ he has certainly inspired me in my lifetime. ” mr. abney grew up in south carolina and retired at the rank of colonel after more than 27 years in the army . <eos> people today don ’ t always have the choice of where or how or what capacity we will serve , abney warned his audience , but he encouraged all to respond to the call . <eos> “ i ’ ve often heard people say how much they wish dr. king were still living today to see the result of his work and service. ” said abney . <eos> “ i remind those people that dr. king was not a selfish man , and that he did not do his work and service for mere gratification or results . <eos> the results of the service are not always instantaneous . <eos> don ’ t forget king ’ s words : all you need is a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love. ” in closing , abney challenged everyone to keep dr. king ’ s dream alive each and every day . <eos> “ i leave you with one question to take with you , ” said abney . <eos> & quot ; what will your dash tell others about your selfless service ? & quot ; the audience responded with a standing ovation . <eos> “ mr . <eos> abney ’ s speech was inspirational and very relevant in terms of how we should live every minute of the day , ” said msg gregory study , installation equal opportunity advisor . <eos> “ abney encouraged us to perform service with passion and from the heart . <eos> the crowd ’ s reaction was 100 percent positive all the way around. ” the fort sam houston elementary school “ exemplary choir ” followed the speech with songs performed on xylophone and glockenspiel , and a choral rendition of michael jackson and lionel richie ’ s “ we are the world. ” dr. king was born jan 15 , 1929. in 1986 , president ronald reagan declared the third monday in january a federal legal holiday commemorating dr. martin luther king 's birthday , which falls on jan. 16 this year . <eos> visit mwr programs on facebook.com/familymwr or on our website < a href= '' http : //www.armymwr.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.armymwr.com < /a >

year twelves last day this is an edited version ( extract ) of an essay by year twelve student simon pedzik . <eos> it was read out by richard howard at the class twelve farewell on friday . <eos> as i reached the end of my primary years i was faced with a decision of where to go next . <eos> i started to think where i would like to spend the next six years of my life . <eos> after searching far and wide my parents and i came across a unique little school , hidden in the eastern suburbs . <eos> on my first visit i was fascinated by the peacocks , chain guttering , and mud brick walls . <eos> i had never seen a school like this one before . <eos> i felt a sense of belonging . <eos> i knew that this school could give me an experience that no other could . <eos> at my interview although i was nervous at first , i quickly saw how nice and friendly mark and walter were and felt at ease . <eos> i had never felt this comfortable around teachers before . <eos> it was an entirely new experience , one that i enjoyed and there were many more to follow as i was gladly accepted as part of the school . <eos> now , i am near the end of my six year journey and i want to tell you what this means to .. this school has allowed me to be myself in every aspect . <eos> it also helped me to overcome my shyness and distance towards people . <eos> the subjects that i have done have assisted in who i have become . <eos> subjects like eurythmy and drama have helped me to express my emotions freely and openly , while others like farming have given me a connection with nature , enabling me to learn outside the classroom in the natural environment . <eos> the camps have also assisted in my connection with the natural world , by allowing me to access some of the most beautiful and secluded places in the world . <eos> i like all the ways i have been able to express myself in a place where there are no wrong answers . <eos> whether it was through music or art , or any other subject i was allowed to learn through experience . <eos> i liked the idea of teachers and students being treated as equals , how everyone is referred to by their first name and how all of us are able to share our meals together . <eos> this had always made me feel more in touch with others and made it a comfortable place to be and learn in . <eos> i value my place here and the friendships which will carry on for many years to come ... this school is like a community that i feel i can always turn to and it is something special that i cherish forever . <eos> although like everything in life , it has faults , i could not imagine a better environment to grow up in . <eos> i know that this is a place i have loved being a part of . <eos> rudolf steiner once wrote , “ no single day passes without a miracle in our lives . <eos> if on some day we find no miracle in our life then we have merely overlooked it ” . <eos> i believe that this school is the miracle i have experienced every day that is sometimes over looked by others . <eos> thank you

upper school opens at santa catalina school on august 29 , 2011 .
anthony graves eats all his carrots . <eos> but only a few months ago , the 13-year-old from new castle filled up on junk food . <eos> “ i used to eat chips , cupcakes and soda , ” he says . <eos> “ now i eat carrots , broccoli and tomatoes. ” anthony is enrolled in < a href= '' http : //www.christianacare.org/campfresh '' rel= '' nofollow '' > camp fresh < /a > , short for & quot ; fresh resources everyone should have , & quot ; founded in 2007 by christiana care ’ s center for community health , part of the department of family and community medicine . <eos> the nine-week program educates youth , ages 13-18 , on nutrition and encourages them to eat healthy foods , while being aware that their food environment could make it difficult to do so . <eos> camp fresh also works with the delaware center for horticulture to educate youths on how people in urban communities can grow their own produce . <eos> on a recent afternoon , anthony and other campers asked people in rodney square to take the 2011 community food access survey to gauge the eating habits of people in the city of wilmington and assess their attitudes on accessibility to healthy foods . <eos> they asked consumers what kinds of food they eat , where they buy groceries and how much they exercise . <eos> results from the first survey , administered in 2007 , found that a lack of access to nutritious foods was a serious obstacle to healthy eating habits . <eos> since then , two new supermarkets have opened―shoprite on market street in wilmington and food lion on governor printz boulevard in edgemoor . <eos> the latest results , to be compiled in the fall , will help to identify continuing barriers in urban communities to eating nutritious , low-fat foods and working out . <eos> richard johnson of bear , a school disciplinarian who took the survey , told anthony that he has given up red meat and fried foods and eats lots of fruits and vegetables . <eos> he thinks camp fresh will have a lasting , positive impact on the youths . <eos> “ working in schools , i see that obesity is a serious problem with kids , ” he says . <eos> “ christiana care is doing a very good thing in teaching kids about nutrition. ” indeed , delawareans are getting fatter , according to a recent study by the trust for america 's health and the robert wood johnson foundation . <eos> the report says 28 percent of adults in the first state are obese , defined as weighing at least 20 percent more than normal . <eos> among children , 33.2 percent are overweight or obese , according to the centers for disease control . <eos> campers come primarily from wilmington , where corner stores carry little fresh produce and supermarkets are not readily accessible . <eos> “ we tell kids that fast food might taste good―but it is not good for you , ” says christopher c. moore , healthy lifestyle coordinator at christiana care ’ s center for community health . <eos> “ we know that if given the right tools and information , the camp fresh youth have the ability to affect a lot of positive change. ” over the years , more than 250 teens have participated in the program . <eos> many say they are learning good habits that will last a lifetime . <eos> “ on the first day , i stopped drinking soda and started drinking water , ” says dkwan brown , 14 , of wilmington . <eos> “ now i eat collard greens and salad . <eos> anything that looks healthy , i will try. ” instead of fried chicken , 13-year-old aionna williams of wilmington asks her mother to make baked chicken . <eos> she and her mom stock up on veggies at shoprite , walmart and target , as well as the camp fresh farmer ’ s market . <eos> “ the corner store is convenient but they don ’ t have healthy foods , only chips and stuff , ” she says . <eos> as for anthony , he has lost 5 pounds and feels more energetic . <eos> “ i can tell that eating healthy foods is good for me , ” he says . <eos> “ that is why i want to get other people on board . ”

all is quiet on the domestic front : a look at intimacy and dwelling was a daylong seminar on the home . <eos> the speakers explored various perceptions and theorisings on the home , the private , and the intimate . <eos> ine gevers began by critically questioning who may be excluded from conventional or traditional notions of the home . <eos> her thesis focused on the significance of listening to those who reside outside the borders of inclusion , the mad , the disabled , and those without residence . <eos> polly gould gave a lecture and performance on “ matter in and out of place ” . <eos> she examined the social taboos around bodily secretions , specifically breast milk and touched upon the blurred and at times contradictory distinctions society makes between the public and private , the sightly and unsightly . <eos> riek sijbring , taking an art historical approach , looked at still life painting and the ways ‘ the feminine ’ was represented through the depiction of floral arrangements within an interior space . <eos> finally , apolonija sustersic compared and contrasted the modernist high architectural visions of le corbusier with the illegal self-built and at times provisional dwellings in slovenia . <eos> at the end of the day there was a discussion among the guest lecturers and the audience . <eos> one of the over arching themes emerging was the necessity to look beyond the spatial qualities of the home and acknowledge its socially constructed borders . <eos> speakers riek sijbring is an artist and writer living in amsterdam . <eos> she studied art at the rijksakademie and has received a laureate in theory from the jan van eyck akademie . <eos> she has exhibited in various spaces such as the veemvloer and the bonnefanten museum . <eos> in 1997 she published an essay in issues 4 entitled “ mute thought : an account of my encounter with the french philosopher maurice merleau ponty ” . <eos> she is a core initiator of stichting de geuzen . <eos> polly gould is an english artist and writer living in maastricht . <eos> she studied art at st. martins and is currently working on a laureate in theory at the jan van eyck akademie . <eos> she has shown work at digital '96 and w139 . <eos> ine gevers is a dutch curator and writer living in utrecht . <eos> she teaches in the department of theory at the jan van eyck akademie and has organised symposia there such as “ place , position , presentation , public ” . <eos> she has co-curated with jeanne van heeswijk the exhibition , “ i + the other , art and the human condition ” . <eos> apolonija sustersic is a slovenian architect and artist living in ljubljana and amsterdam . <eos> she has a degree in architecture from the university of ljubljana in slovenia and has done post-graduate studies in art at the rijksakademie in amsterdam . <eos> she was included in the triennial of contemporary slovenian art at the museum of modern art in slovenia and manifesta 2. the reader annie toop in collaboration with de geuzen . <eos> annie toop is an english artist living in amsterdam . <eos> she studied art at both the ruskin school of fine art at oxford university and the rijksakademie . <eos> she has exhibited at the i.c.a . <eos> london , w139 and has had works published in mute-digital arts magazine .

did you know it takes longer for fishing wire to decompose than an aluminum can ? <eos> can you name some of the fish that are part of virginia 's saltwater game fish tagging program ? <eos> these are just some of the things students who participated in 2011 urbanna oyster festival marine science legacy day heard about at the vims booth , led by members of virginia sea grant 's marine extension program at vims . <eos> after talking to students about marine debris and the game fish tagging program , anne smith ( clean marina specialist ) and susanna musick ( marine recreation specialist ) led students in a fishing game . <eos> students would use a rod and reel to pull in either a fish or a type of marine debris . <eos> then they 'd take their catch over to a table to look up information about it . <eos> the urbanna oyster festival marine science legacy day brings hundreds of elementary school students to urbanna , va to learn about science , conservation , and issues in the chesapeake bay . <eos> for more information about virginia sea grant and our educational activities , visit < a href= '' http : //vaseagrant.vims.edu '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vaseagrant.vims.edu < /a >

the old unicef staff hark back to when jim grant was the executive director . <eos> they tell tales of a world without internet and management software , when unicef ’ s job was to take the words of the people to the ear of the minister , when what counted was mud on your boots . <eos> i had one of those days monday and it was wonderful . <eos> i went out to coach a team from our kankan field office on how to monitor projects . <eos> we got to niagassola at the end of the day . <eos> it is a small village in the far north east of the country . <eos> from the tarmac it was about a three hour drive along a track over dusty plains some chalk white others with the red grit of laterite . <eos> after dark we settled down with men and women from the village . <eos> the weather was 23c , with a damp mist in the air . <eos> i have never felt such cold weather in upper guinea . <eos> so we huddled together around a fire . <eos> they told up about how the school and the health centre were working and what were their biggest concerns for themselves and their children . <eos> i got the feeling that people in niagassola are not shy of telling us what they think , but there is something about talking in the dark at the end of the day that loosens up your tongue . <eos> there was a griot , a story teller , a poet , in the group and he conjured up words from the fire to show us how things were . <eos> we sat , listened and noted . <eos> we were with a couple of colleagues from the government who were from the regional administrative capital in kankan . <eos> both experienced , senior officials , it was a first for them , so they said , to sit down and hear what the people had on their minds .
area i ’ s first-ever girl scouts ready to serve , learn , giggle by franklin fisher usag red cloud public affairs camp red cloud , south korea C they ’ re new , they ’ re here , they ’ re eager to learn and serve , they ’ re area i ’ s first-ever girl scout troop , troop 512 of the girl scouts of america overseas . <eos> they only just started meeting this january , and so far they ’ re few C 10 girls ages 7 to 12 , and two girl scout leaders , both of whom are area i army spouses . <eos> it ’ s a “ multi-level ” troop that accommodates brownies , juniors and cadettes . <eos> they meet twice a month at the casey elementary school , where all the girls happen to be students . <eos> in coming weeks and months troop 512 will be doing all sorts of things that girl scouts do holding meetings , taking trips , going camping , making friends and spending time with the korean girl scouts , learning teamwork . <eos> lots of giggling too , probably . <eos> and then , of course , there ’ s that signature girl scout classic , the selling of cookies . <eos> and when it comes to that , there ’ s no telling what heights the girls of troop 512 will scale , judging by their success selling cookies this past season , january 13 C february 24. the girls C there were only eight active at the time C managed to sell a hard-driving 3,800 boxes of cookies . <eos> and that was strictly inside area i installations , those of the casey enclave in dongducheon and at camp red cloud in uijeongbu . <eos> that works out to 475 boxes per girl , well above the 100 to 200 boxes a girl scout in the states typically sells during the cookie season , said laura jones , who along with shawna garrett serves as scout leader for troop 512 . <eos> “ the girls worked hard , we ’ re very proud of them , ” said garrett . <eos> “ with our one little troop , we saturated camp casey , ” she said . <eos> “ they ’ re so tired of girl scout cookies here it ’ s not even funny. ” the scouts met with unstinting support and encouragement from the area i community , including commissaries , exchanges and military units , and from individuals who either bought cookies or donated money to support the troop , jones and garrett said . <eos> “ the most important thing is how fantastic area i has been , ” said garrett . <eos> “ we had as much people offering to help us as we could ever possibly hope for. ” for courtney garrett , 11 , a 6th-grader , cookie-selling is one of her favorite girl scout activities so far . <eos> “ it ’ s fun because like we get to talk to random people and like , make them laugh , even though you don ’ t know them . <eos> “ and it ’ s kind of like you got a good feeling , ‘ cause you made someone ’ s day by giving them cookies that they can only get once and year and stuff. ” her fellow-scout kaylee jones , 10 , a fourth-grader , is looking forward to chances to “ learn things ” through upcoming trips like one they ’ ll be making to an aquarium . <eos> “ we get to learn about the sea and the animals that live there , ” she said . <eos> “ i just really like to see the animals and the fish and stuff. ” but she also got a kick out of cookie sales . <eos> “ it ’ s just really fun , like , trying to make cheers and chants , ” she said . <eos> “ what we did was we were acting like we were cheerleaders and then said ‘ girl scout cookies inside , $ 3.50 a box or 5,000 won. ’ ” having its first-ever girl scout troop is another milestone in the transformation of area i into a place where soldiers served accompanied by their families , said col. hank dodge , commander , u.s. army garrison red cloud and area i . <eos> “ we think it ’ s a great thing because it shows the progress that we ’ ve made in a very short time , ” said dodge . <eos> within the past year-and-a-half to two years , he said , area i has gone from having only 62 slots for command-sponsored families to more than 3,500 slots . <eos> but it ’ s also good for the girls , he said . <eos> “ it contributes to the life of the children , ” said dodge . <eos> “ it teaches them teamwork , it teaches them discipline , it teaches them respect for one another . <eos> and then it teaches them to serve not only themselves but to serve each other and to serve the community . ”

country music legend kenny rogers performs state theatre , sydney ; australian music legend john williamson supports ... kenny rogers is an american singer-songwriter , record producer , actor , photographer and entrepreneur . <eos> he has been most successful with country audiences and has charted more than 120 hit singles across various music genres and topping the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the united states alone . <eos> tonight rogers performed to an appreciative australian audience at the famous state theatre in sydney . <eos> he was supported by australian country legend john williamson and i could n't think of a better support in the world , but there can be little doubt that the majority of people were there to see rogers . <eos> both artists engaged with the audience , as only season veterans could do . <eos> rogers even got into a money throwing act with a fan . <eos> rogers is one of very few artists who have enjoyed successful careers in such a variety of genres - jazz , folk , rock , country and pop . <eos> houston-born rogers formed his first band while in high school in 1956 - a rockabilly group called the scholars ( they performed on american bandstand ) - and has never quit making music . <eos> he played stand-up bass in the jazz group the bobby doyle trio , and later became a member of the popular folk group , the new christy minstrels . <eos> the spotlight started focusing on rogers when his group , the first edition , scored their first hit , & quot ; i just dropped in ( to see what condition my condition was in ) , which was followed by the pop and country chart success of & quot ; ruby , do n't take your love to town. & quot ; rogers ' solo career shot into the stratosphere with the # 1 hit , & quot ; lucille , & quot ; which was named the cma 's single of the year and was certified gold . <eos> & quot ; daytime friends , & quot ; & quot ; sweet music man , & quot ; and & quot ; love or something like it & quot ; continued his run of success . <eos> then came & quot ; the gambler , & quot ; a story song so vivid it not only delighted country and pop fans , it also became a tv movie , starring rogers himself in the title role . <eos> the movie spawned four follow-ups , making it the longest running miniseries franchise on television . <eos> the five gambler mini-series have attracted over 100 million viewers nationwide and launched a second career for rogers as an actor on television and movies . <eos> news ... kenny rogers autobiography out in october ... with rogers 50 years of performing and 120 million album sales , there 's a lot to write about . <eos> he says & quot ; it stirs up certain emotions that you 'd forgotten about . <eos> particularly when your life has been as busy as mine - it 's kind of hard to keep up with things & quot ; & quot ; i must admit i enjoyed writing it . <eos> i enjoyed that process . <eos> i do n't know that i 'd want to do it again. & quot ; more news ... the pinnacle of his career is in the late 1970s to '80s and includes hits such as the gambler , lucille , coward of the county and , with dolly parton , islands in the stream . <eos> he has had 24 no.1 hits . <eos> & quot ; once i started with lucille [ in 1977 ] , it was like an indescribable career for anybody , so you have a look at that and say : how can you not have enjoyed that ? & quot ; rogers says . <eos> & quot ; but i have to tell ya : too much success is not good either . <eos> i 'm at a great place right now where i sign enough autographs to satisfy my ego , but not so many that it invades my privacy. & quot ; in 2009 rogers did widespread touring under the anniversary banner the first fifty years . <eos> he still performs or records about 100 days annually . <eos> but turning 74 next week , with a much younger wife and twin eight-year-old boys at his home in atlanta , he expects his australian concerts will be his last here . <eos> & quot ; this is probably gon na be my last international tour , & quot ; he says . <eos> it 's because his family ca n't be with him . <eos> & quot ; so i think when i come back … that 's gon na be it . <eos> i 'm gon na stay home then . <eos> & quot ; i 'll continue to tour the states . <eos> i 'd just like to be able to get home [ more ] so i can spend what i think is quality time with the boys … i really wan na be there for 'em instead of being gone all the time. & quot ; rogers has said his one regret is the toll his pursuit of success had on his relationships . <eos> but & quot ; i do n't want to go back and rehash things that i was honest about and paid the price for . <eos> i do n't want to pay it again. & quot ; kenny rogers will also play at the state theatre tomorrow night , again supported by john williamson . <eos> if rogers other performances down under in australia are anything like tonight 's , fans are in for a massive treat from this true music legend , and his new aussie legend mate . <eos> australian tour dates ... sydney , nsw australia august 16 , 2012 9:00 p.m. state theatre with special guest john williamson darwin , northern territory australia august 18 , 2012 9:45 p.m. darwin festival george brown botanic gardens with special guest sara storer perth , australia august 21 , 2012 9:00 p.m. riverside theatre perth convention & amp ; exhibition centre with special guest troy cassar daley melbourne , vic australia august 23 , 2012 9:00 p.m. palais theatre with special guest troy cassar daley newcastle , nsw australia august 24 , 2012 8:00 p.m. newcastle entertainment centre with special guest lee kernaghan gympie , queensland australia august 26 , 2012 8:00 p.m. gympie music muster adelaide , australia august 29 , 2012 9:00 p.m. adelaide entertainment centre with special guest beccy cole websites kenny rogers official website < a href= '' http : //www.kennyrogers.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.kennyrogers.com < /a > john williamson official website < a href= '' http : //www.johnwilliamson.com.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.johnwilliamson.com.au < /a > state theatre < a href= '' http : //www.statetheatre.com.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.statetheatre.com.au < /a > eva rinaldi photography flickr < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography '' > www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography < /a > eva rinaldi photography < a href= '' http : //www.evarinaldi.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.evarinaldi.com < /a > music news australia < a href= '' http : //www.musicnewsaustralia.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.musicnewsaustralia.com < /a >

last night , we attended a performance of & quot ; jazz on the park , & quot ; on the 5th floor of the time-warner building in nyc -- which looks out over columbus circle and portions of the southwest corner of central park . <eos> it made me realize that even though i 've walked and driven through and around columbus circle hundreds ( perhaps even thousands ) of times since the late 1960s , i 've never really stopped to look closely at it . <eos> the view at sunset last night was particularly lovely , because there were small , focused floodlights illuminating the fountains around the large statue of christopher of columbus . <eos> the lighting was completely different when i returned today in the middle of the day , but as i suspected , there was a lot more activity -- with tourists and residents , picnickers and sunbathers , children and adults all enjoying the warm summer weather and the pleasant background sights and sounds of the fountain . <eos> hopefully these few pictures -- the best 10 % of the 150 i took during my brief stroll around ( and around and around ) the circular monument/mini-park -- will give you a feeling for yet another interesting and memorable little corner of the big apple .

dolly parton and her bus coming to sydney i 'm pleased to report that country music legend dolly parton has hit australian soil ( as has her now famous bus ) ... first stop perth . <eos> the better day world tour , just off a bit of trouble with australian customs officials is now on the road , australian style . <eos> the bus is understood to be safe at the burswood dome , and is in fine shape to tour the rest of the land down under . <eos> for a while all the trouble with the bus led dolly ’ s us management to threaten to withdraw her presence from australia altogether . <eos> the country music legend , whose career spans four and a half decades , never tours without the massive bus , staying in it along with members of her entourage wherever she performs . <eos> chugg entertainment manager matthew lazarus-hall , the tour ’ s australian promoter , said : & quot ; the message was kind of , 'no bus ― no tour ’ . & quot ; but after receiving an urgent fax from mr lazarus-hall late in july , mr albanese leapt into action , liaising with customs as well as state and federal bureaucrats , to avoid an international incident . <eos> mr albanese ’ s actions to save the tour also received a warm response from dolly . <eos> an email from her us manager stated : & quot ; dolly and her people are very pleased to hear the bus is coming and it ’ s all sorted and has promised minister albo a huge cuddle when she comes to australia in november. & quot ; the 65-year-old country singer was last in australia nearly thirty years ago , with her tour expected to inject tens of millions of dollars via sales , tourism and use of local suppliers into the economy . <eos> the ultra talented singer of hits such as 9 to 5 and jolene will perform 12 australian concerts during the last leg of her better day world tour . <eos> described as & quot ; the original genuine fake & quot ; , parton is expected to attract a queen 's welcome from her huge aussie fan base during her three-week visit . <eos> decades after finding fame , parton , 65 , still attracts young fans and she has more than a million followers on twitter . <eos> famous for her huge bust and love of plastic surgery , it 's her southern-drawl & quot ; dollyisms & quot ; that make her adored worldwide . <eos> among them : & quot ; it takes a lot of money to make a person look this cheap & quot ; and & quot ; people are always asking my advice , but i 'm not the dolly lama ! & quot ; we hear dolly still has it . <eos> you ca n't miss her , and if you do , just look for her famous bust ... err bus . <eos> websites dolly parton < a href= '' http : //www.dollyparton.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.dollyparton.com < /a > all phones arena < a href= '' http : //www.allphonesarena.com.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.allphonesarena.com.au < /a > chugg entertainment < a href= '' http : //www.chuggentertainment.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.chuggentertainment.com < /a > eva rinaldi photography flickr < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography '' > www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography < /a > eva rinaldi photography < a href= '' http : //www.evarinaldi.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.evarinaldi.com < /a >

17 august - satellite sentinel project ( ssp ) has identified three new apparent mass grave sites in and around kadugli in south kordofan , sudan based on an analysis of digitalglobe satellite imagery and multiple eyewitness accounts . <eos> the three alleged mass grave sites identified in this report are separate from and in addition to the three apparent mass graves south of the tilo school in kadugli shown in ssp ’ s 14 july 2011 report . <eos> near the hagar al nar neighborhood of kadugli , ssp has documented the apparent ongoing burial of white bundles in a remote wooded location over the past month that appear consistent with human remains covered in some form of tarps . <eos> in the murta area , government of sudan-aligned forces appear to be concealing the presence of an alleged mass grave underneath a water tower near kadugli , corroborating claims made in the 15 august un human rights report on south kordofan . <eos> these actions could constitute efforts by the government of sudan to actively conceal evidence of potential war crimes and crimes against humanity . <eos> ssp has also corroborated an eyewitness account of an alleged mass grave outside a private garden of mango and lime trees in the hagar al nar neighborhood of kadugli . <eos> please credit all images : digitalglobe for satellite sentinel project

one of the fort wainwright garrison commander ’ s responsibilities is government-to- government relations with the federally-recognized tribes of the upper tanana river , including consulting with all the local tribes in the interior . <eos> when world war ii veteran paul kirsteatter died , said col. ron johnson , fort wainwright garrison commander , “ i wanted to do something to recognize his service . <eos> so i talked to the family and told them since he was a veteran he was entitled to some benefits for his funeral and that sort of thing and asked if they would be interested. ” the family accepted and planning began immediately . <eos> however , arranging this sort of tribute for a man who resided at healy lake , with a year-round population of less than 20 which is generally only accessible by boat , helicopter or float plane had to be planned like a military operation johnson said . <eos> “ it took some coordination with ( u.s. army alaska ) ; developed a primary course of action , a contingency course of action and an emergency course of action. ” “ the original plan was to take a couple of riverboats from family and morale welfare and recreation and local community guys to ferry them to healy lake . <eos> it ’ s challenging and a little risky , ” he said . <eos> “ once we saw teams were too big for boats , we got support from usarak , from aviation , allowing us to fly everyone in. ” instead of turning this over to the casualty assistance office , as is usually done , johnson contacted col. brian reed , commander of the 1st stryker brigade combat team , 25th infantry division , known as the “ arctic wolves. ” johnson told reed that he had a great chance for some soldiers to experience a part of alaska that few ever get a chance to see and asked if he had some soldiers who might appreciate the opportunity . <eos> reed decided to award it to the soldiers of the brigade troops battalion , and lt. col. michael braun , commander of the btb , selected 12 arctic wolves he considered worthy . <eos> they were accompanied by a musician from the 9th army band and flown to the remote village by four members of b company , 1st battalion , 52nd aviation regiment in a chinook helicopter . <eos> the celebration of life was beside the lake , near kirsteatter ’ s cabin . <eos> as part of the ceremony , the band ’ s bugler played “ taps ” and the soldiers fired a 21-gun salute . <eos> a soldier then presented an american flag to kirsteatter ’ s daughter dorothy . <eos> following the ceremony , the villagers held potluck dinner in the community hall , where the soldiers had a chance to interact with kirsteatter ’ s family and friends . <eos> “ it was really amazing , ” said spc . <eos> john keeling , 73rd engineer company , brigade troops battalion , 1-25th sbct . <eos> “ i had never done anything like this before ; it was my first time and it was special doing this for a veteran - not just for a veteran , but a world war ii veteran . <eos> it is a pretty big deal to us . <eos> “ the community reception has been amazing ” he said . <eos> “ they opened up and it was just nice to hear everybody ’ s comments and then they made food for everybody . <eos> we felt welcome . ”

the life of a caterer most people are under the impression that being a caterer is all fun , games and good times . <eos> while this may be true in seldom cases , according to stephanie trammer , age 61 , being a caterer more realistically reflects hard work , long hours , low wages and a lot of patience . <eos> stephanie , who is a world famous bass player , decided 15 years ago that she was going to hang up her first passion and make her second into a profitable career . <eos> it was then that she joined forces with critic ’ s choice catering and made it into what it is today : the number one caterer in the south bay . <eos> stephanie has always loved to cook so taking the opportunity to turn this hobby into a career was something that she was determined to do . <eos> she has planned , decorated and catered more events than most can think of and for a variety of cultures ! <eos> her most memorable of these events was actually one of her first events which was a wedding for a mexican american couple . <eos> “ the bride and groom were wasted before the ceremony began ! ” she said . <eos> “ the funniest part about it was that they had decided to have the wedding at an alcohol free venue in hopes of deterring rowdiness , but they were ten times rowdier than anyone they had worried about ! ” the best part , according to stephanie , was when the bride tried to jump in the pool- wedding dress and all ! ” events like these , however , are few and far between . <eos> most brides are inpatient , over demanding , rude and have unrealistic expectations . <eos> a regular day for stephanie starts bright and early with a trip to her catering office to help pack upcoming parties , make food , decorate platters and pack vehicles . <eos> if she isn ’ t scheduled to work an event immediately afterwards , she ’ ll schedule her first meetings with clients who are interested in working with her . <eos> these days are usually 6-12 hours long . <eos> on wednesdays stephanie likes to schedule any location walk through appointments where she meets clients at the desired location , goes over kitchen arrangements , seating arrangements , entrances , exits , bars , tables , décor , and music . <eos> “ this is the most important appointment ” according to stephanie “ because it is when i help them visualize the idea they have and mold it into what it will become ” . <eos> while this line of work can be “ grueling ” and sometimes “ unbearable ” , making people happy with her cuisine and helping them celebrate important times in their lives makes it all worth while for stephanie . <eos> when asked if she ’ d wished she had chosen another path instead of catering , stephanie broke out in laughter and said “ ya ! <eos> but honestly , no . <eos> i met some of my closest and dearest friends at events i had done for friends of them and i wouldn ’ t trade those memories with them for anything ” . <eos> if you or anyone you know is in need of an exquisite caterer with a rocking background and a keen eye for perfection , stephanie trammer with critic ’ s choice is the perfect fit for you .

as i noted in some earlier flickr albums , as long as i continue going to the same dentist , you can count on two or three sets of photos of bryant park each year . <eos> the reason is simple : my dentist is located in mid-town manhattan , about a block from the park , and when i 'm done , i 'm always tempted to walk over and see how the park looks . <eos> i had a different dentist in the 70s and 80s -- but in any case , i 've collected eight separate sets of bryant park photos , which you can see summarized < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/collections/72157622038576289/ '' > here < /a > on flickr . <eos> at least one or two of those other sets will provide you with the historical details of the park ; or you can look it up < a href= '' http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bryant_park '' rel= '' nofollow '' > here < /a > on wikipedia . <eos> as for this particular visit , it was a lunchtime period , but it was dark and overcast , with a threat of rain . <eos> indeed , it looked so ominous that i was n't sure i should stay at all , nor was i sure that anyone else would be here . <eos> the wide promenade immediately behind ( i.e. , to the west of ) the library building was mostly empty ; but there were various people sitting at tables and chairs along the northern , western , and southern edges of the park . <eos> so , after surveying the scene , i decided that it was worth the effort to make at least one circumnavigational loop , to photograph whatever looked interesting . <eos> it did not include anyone lounging or sunbathing out on the grassy lawn , as that had been closed off to allow the grass to recover from heavy rainfall the week before . <eos> indeed , shortly after i finished my circumnavigational loop and returned to my starting point , it started to rain once again . <eos> i found myself a protected spot under an umbrella that was normally meant to shade lunch-time visitors from the rays of the sun , and photographed a few more people as they wandered past with their own umbrellas . <eos> as the rain faded away into an intermittent drizzle , i spotted something unexpected over at the southeast corner of the lawn : first one guy , and then a second guy , juggling large aluminum bowling pins high into the air . <eos> well , anyway , they < i > looked < /i > like bowling pins ; maybe they were specifically designed to be & quot ; juggling pins. & quot ; anyway , i took some photos from a distance , and then walked over to be closer to where they were standing . <eos> they were very friendly , and one of the jugglers told me that they come out to the park every day to show their stuff -- either because they have an intense need to entertain visitors to the park , or perhaps because they hope that someone might hire them to entertain at a birthday party or wall street orgy . <eos> it was the first time i had seen them in all of my visits to bryant park , but perhaps it wo n't be the last ... interesting as the juggling was , there 's only so much you can do with it from a photographic perspective . <eos> i actually took some 200 different photos , because i was n't sure what it would look like when various bowling pins were & quot ; frozen & quot ; in mid-flight ; but i ended up keeping only four of them , which you 'll see at the end of this flickr set . <eos> after that , there really was n't anything else to see . <eos> i packed up my camera gear and headed back up to the upper west side . <eos> but i 'll be back to see the dentist a few months from now , and i 'll try to stop by the park again , to see what it looks like in the winter season ...

playboy business : kendra wilkinson reality in sydney at ivy she 's known for a few things , mainly playboy , the playboy mansion , and all that , but now she 's got a reality tv show , and us australians are going to find out all about it . <eos> the 26-year-old model - actor - entrepreneur has been spotted sight seeing in sydney , while getting ready to promote her self titled reality tv show , kendra . <eos> the blonde media heat seeker , always very well-known for being one of hugh hefner 's lucky three girlfriends had a whale of a time enjoying a boat cruise around sydney harbour with her mum , while taking photos . <eos> yes , her photo was also taken . <eos> kendra arrived in down under on 13th october and snatched quite a few cheers and wolf whistle 's from the sydney airport staff . <eos> the walk past is understood to have lifted the striking workers spirits . <eos> naughty , naughty . <eos> the glamour model did tonight ( or at least the first part of it ) at the exclusive sydney night spot , the ivy . <eos> like many a celeb , she 's quite the fan of twitter , yesterday tweeting : 'wow i 'm having the best time in sydney ! ! <eos> australia is amazing ! <eos> ca n't wait to show you guys my pics from my trip ! ' <eos> kendra 's reality tv show focuses mainly on her life after leaving the famous playboy mansion and getting engaged to then philadelphia eagles receiver , hank baskett . <eos> kendra is understood to enjoy ball sports . <eos> the star 's virgin appearance on tv was via the tv series 'the girls next door ' , which followed the lives of playboy hefner 's , then-girlfriends : kendra , holly madison , and bridget marquardt . <eos> before you could say playboy bunny , kendra moved out of the playboy mansion in 2009 after meeting future husband hank , and began filming her kendra . <eos> american audiences were into the show and kendra is praying that australian audiences will feel the same way too . <eos> well , they are bound to feel something , so hopefully its good . <eos> the former dancing with the stars contestant married hank in june 2009 , and their boy hank iv was born in december of that year . <eos> in case you were wondering , the star 's family have not joined her on her latest press trip . <eos> kendra looked to be enjoying herself at the ivy tonight , and it sure looks like she 's into the australian mantra of & quot ; work hard , play harder. & quot ; the looker has told australian press : & quot ; the mansion will always be a part of my life and i 'm very appreciative of that . <eos> especially hef . <eos> he is like family . <eos> so when the time comes i will open up to my son about my days there and the stuff i went through , & quot ; she said . <eos> & quot ; i knew what i wanted . <eos> it was always to have a family & quot ; . <eos> & quot ; no one really expected that of me . <eos> i went away that no one thought i would go . <eos> everyone thought i was the crazy party girl but i did what everyone thought i would n't do and made a huge turn-around in my life . <eos> i always wanted to be a mother and a wife . <eos> & quot ; i lived at the mansion from the age of 18 to 21 and once i had that experience and that whole party thing out of my system i was really ready to settle down. & quot ; australian news hounds are expected to continue to track her every movement , and kendra plays along in the game , making sure everyone knows about her new upcoming reality tv show . <eos> kendra : 9.30pm from october 18 , only on e ! <eos> websites the ivy < a href= '' http : //www.merivale.com/ # /ivy/ivyroom '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.merivale.com/ # /ivy/ivyroom < /a > foxtel : e ! <eos> < a href= '' http : //www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/e ! /default.htm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/e ! /default.htm < /a > splash news < a href= '' http : //www.splashnews.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.splashnews.com < /a > eva rinaldi photography < a href= '' http : //www.evarinaldi.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.evarinaldi.com < /a > eva rinaldi photography flickr < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography '' > www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography < /a >

the 4th class recognition ceremony was conducted on may 20 after the morning formation which allowed other classes to offer words of encouragement and congratulations to the class of 2014 after completing their first academic year at west point . <eos> while the class of 2011 will graduate the following day and become commissioned second lieutenants in the u.s. army , the other classes will begin the day with a promotion ceremony to recognize their rising status at west point . <eos> the class of 2014 will become rising yearlings , about to encounter the challenges of cadet field training at camp buckner .
following the class of 2011 graduation parade on may 20 , each regiment in the corps of cadets marched to their formation areas for i company activation ceremonies . <eos> this would not be the first activation of an i company ; historically , when the size of corps requires it , regiments will absorb additional companies . <eos> the national defense authorization act of 1965 increased the corps authorized strength from 2,505 cadets to 4,417 cadets . <eos> by 1967 the corps grew to 3,370 cadets and expanded from 24 to 32 companies C the very same organization uscc has in place today with an authorized strength of 4,400. in 1969 , the corps numbered at 3,785 and added four more cadet companies for a total of 36 companies Cthe desired organizational design for today ’ s 4,400 cadets . <eos> the ndaa of 2009 directed the corps strength back to 4,400. the expansion to 36 companies increases cadet to tac team interaction given a 10 % decrease of cadets in each company . <eos> this increased interaction is vital to the support and assessment functions which are the cornerstone of our cadet leader development system .

some pics that date to 2004 , others as late as december 2007. i originally found this camera on a shelf cleaning up after our halloween party in 2004. i slowly used up the exposures , and finally developed in 2007. not all of the pictures came out . <eos> i am pretty sure i took some pictures in my current apartment , but if so , none of those came out . <eos> some of the pictures that were developed were just washes of color . <eos> regardless of whether you let them sit for a few years , disposable cameras just suck .

wondering where the rest of these went ? <eos> ?
ever since i first arrived in new york city in the late 60s , i 've known that the & quot ; scene & quot ; in the east village was centered in st. marks place and tompkins square ; that 's where you went to find the music , the hippies , the drugs , the homeless people , and the excitement ... and , quite often , the cops and the folks that you 'd just as soon not encounter after dark . <eos> but despite having ridden and driven past the park numerous times , i never actually spent any time there ; so , in the spirit of checking out my long list of unexplored spots in the big apple , i decided to spend an hour or two in the park this past weekend . <eos> while i knew that tompkins square park had maintained a certain level of notoriety since the 60s , i did n't realize that its & quot ; activist & quot ; roots went back much further . <eos> opened in 1850m and named after daniel tompkins -- a vice president under james monroe , and the governor of new york from 1808-1817 -- the park was the scene of the deadly 1863 draft riots during the civil war , and was the scene of attacks , in 1857 , by the police on immigrants protesting unemployment and food shortages . <eos> it was also the scene of the & quot ; tompkins square riot & quot ; in 1874 , when police crushed a demonstration involving several thousand workers ; and the scene of a squabble with the national guard in 1877 when 5,000 people gathered to hear communist revolutionary speeches . <eos> well , all of that is past -- and even the riot of august 1988 , when 44 people were injured when police attempted to clear the park of homeless people seems lost in dim memories . <eos> today , the park is clean and friendly , with lots of children , families , and people with dogs wandering its pathways and stretching out on the large grassy areas . <eos> at the same time , i found that it lacked the energy , the vitality , and the hard-to-define & quot ; buzz & quot ; that i 've felt in other parks around the city . <eos> there were no musicians , no artists , no jugglers , no mimes , no fountains with children splashing in the water . <eos> there was a guy making some kind of religious speech on a loudspeaker , but most people ignored him ; the only comment i heard was a loud , grouchy , & quot ; aw , shut up ! & quot ; from someone passing by . <eos> there were a couple of chess games underway at the entrance on 7th street and avenue & quot ; a , & quot ; but even those seemed somewhat listless and lackluster ... maybe i just picked the wrong weekend ; it turns out , for example , that the french embassy and the nyc department of parks sponsor a free outdoor french film festival at sunset on friday nights in june and july . <eos> and then there 's the halloween party ( in october , obviously , not in april ) , which boasts an annual attendance of 2,000 spectators and 400 costumed dogs ( all of which is part of a fundraiser to maintain the large dog run in one corner of the park ) . <eos> but while i was here , i wandered around and took a couple hundred photos of the people who seemed most interesting ... from which i chose 20 that seemed worthy of uploading to flickr . <eos> that 's what you 'll find in this set .

guard aviation soldiers return to n.d. after serving in iraq bismarck , n.d. ― after a year of serving in iraq and completing thousands of flight hours , forty-five soldiers of the north dakota national guard ’ s bismarck based company c , 2nd battalion , 285th aviation regiment ( c/2-285th avn ) are back in north dakota . <eos> over 200 family members and friends welcomed them home shortly after 2 p.m. , when their charter flight arrived at the bismarck airport ’ s main terminal . <eos> two of the soldiers live out of state and traveled separately to minnesota . <eos> the 47 soldiers have been on active duty since last october and served in iraq since december . <eos> “ these aviation soldiers have done an outstanding job serving in iraq and have proudly represented our state and nation , ” said gov . <eos> john hoeven who was on hand to greet the soldiers . <eos> “ today , we welcome them home with our heartfelt gratitude for their service and sacrifice , and we thank their families who also served their country throughout this deployment. ” before returning home , the soldiers arrived at hufort sillu , okla. last wednesday to complete their demobilization process . <eos> humaj . <eos> gen. david sprynczynatykuh , north dakota adjutant general , and other senior leaders traveled to oklahoma to welcome the soldiers home , and they also greeted the soldiers upon their arrival in bismarck . <eos> “ these soldiers have been away from their families , friends and communities , performing outstanding aviation tasks throughout iraq for a year , ” sprynczynatyk said . <eos> “ they highly commended for their professionalism by their command . <eos> i am proud of all they have accomplished during this deployment and happy to be among the family and friends welcoming them home. ” the unit flew more than 750 combat missions totaling more than 6,200 flight hours . <eos> assigned to the 1st infantry division , they were responsible for transporting senior officials , soldiers , medical supplies and other cargo in iraq . <eos> the unit is commanded by capt . <eos> douglas larsen , of granville , n.d. the senior enlisted soldier is 1st sgt . <eos> daniel marquart , of bismarck . <eos> the typical aviator averages 100-125 flight hours and the typical crew chief averages 75-100 flight hours per year in north dakota . <eos> on the average , the flight crews are getting 350-500 flight hours on this deployment . <eos> that equals roughly four years worth of experience for a typical pilot and roughly five years worth of experience for a crew chief as compared to typical home station flight time . <eos> the enlisted members have also gained many years worth of valuable maintenance experience . <eos> “ the experience gained in iraq will definitely improve the north dakota army national guard aviation program . <eos> put it all together and we will have strong , knowledgeable , and experienced crews available for any future homeland defense or state emergency missions , ” larsen said . <eos> company c is comprised of 10 blackhawk helicopters and assigned crews of which north dakota has five , with the other half comprised of soldiers from the utah army national guard . <eos> the unit consists of pilots , crew chiefs , door gunners , mechanics , fuelers and flight operations personnel . <eos> ―― since the 2001 terrorist attacks on america , the north dakota national guard has mobilized more than 3,500 soldiers and more than 1,800 airmen in support of the global war on terrorism . <eos> currently , about 75 north dakota guardsmen are serving overseas while more than 4,000 remain in the state for emergency response and national defense . <eos> for every 10,000 citizens in north dakota , 65 serve in the north dakota national guard , a rate that ’ s more than four times the national average . <eos> # # #

sights and scenes around burano , another town on another island near venice . <eos> burano is famous for its many colourful buildings and houses , and rightly so . <eos> i think it also gets fewer tourists because it 's a longer boat ride from venice ( as opposed lido or murano ) . <eos> at least it seemed a lot quieter when we were there . <eos> all in all it was a very pleasant visit .
on dec. 20 , 2009 my apartment building caught fire and i had to find a new place to live . <eos> most of my things were spared from the fire and hoses , but my neighbors and even my roommates were n't so lucky . <eos> eight out of 12 units in the building were completely destroyed , and the woman living upstairs from me lost her cat to the fire . <eos> her family could salvage only an urn of a relative 's ashes . <eos> the general belief is that the fire began in a stairwell outside my door and up one floor , by a cigarette and some trash .

fireworks .
at rachel and joe 's
i , along with a good chunk of extended family , watched the show from my grandmother 's condo in orem . <eos> for the most part , i just blindly clicked the shutter while watching through binoculars . <eos> i 'm surprised so many of my photos turned out well -- the show was so relentless that only one or two shots did n't have spectacular fireworks visible in them .
from the opening activities and and counter-demonstration in washington , d.c. , marking the beginning of the & quot ; troops home fast & quot ; hunger strike over the independence day holiday . <eos> organizations represented included code pink women for peace , the granny peace brigade , veterans for peace , iraq veterans against the war , gold star families for peace .

first attempt at shooting fireworks
i escaped the bay life onto twin peaks for the 4th of july . <eos> windy as all hell , with finger numbing cold that reminded me of school in northern wisconsin , the thing i was most grateful for was the baileys in my coffee . <eos> if you look closely at most of these photographs , you can see the shaking of the smoke trails , because at an effective 270mm zoom even a slight wind was enough to cause the camera to shake , despite the heavy bogen tripod . <eos> i cropped many of these photographs to play to the subject . <eos> i do n't usually crop photos , but i suppose in some cases there should be exceptions .

celebration of 4th of july in bolinas is a very interesting event . <eos> from the & quot ; tug of war & quot ; between bolinas and stinson that goes on in the morning to the parade and all the live music acts around town , a very ( un ) patriotic ( at least as long as the current government is around ) way of celebrating this holiday .
macy 's fireworks on the east river from my roof at 429 e 52nd street . <eos> these look best when viewed at their original and larger size . <eos> taken utilizing the s2 is fireworks setting . <eos> no tripod was used , but i was lucky enough to have the camera resting on the 4ft wall of the roof 38 floors up .

one album . <eos> two men . <eos> too many instruments . <eos> a marathon of multi-instrumentalism . <eos> two ambitious musicians take up more than 20 instruments to present mike oldfield 's classic hittubular bells in a unique musical - and acrobatic - performance . <eos> oldfield 's beautiful and sprawling progressive celtic-folk-rock opus shot to number one in charts around the world in 1973-4. now sydney multi-instrumentalists daniel holdsworth and aidan roberts have arranged the entire score of tubular bells to be played live by just two blokes , bringing the influential masterpiece to life in all its multi-layered madness and subtle beauty . <eos> website sydney festival < a href= '' http : //www.sydneyfestival.org.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.sydneyfestival.org.au < /a > splash news < a href= '' http : //www.splashnews.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.splashnews.com < /a > music news australia < a href= '' http : //www.musicnewsaustralia.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.musicnewsaustralia.com < /a >

we spent an afternoon at henderson golf course with ian blokland . <eos> fun had by all .
this morning we walked down the greenway that runs through our suburb . <eos> there are 3 or 4 miles of it right now , and eventually it will connect many of these neighborhoods with the university , allowing people to walk or bike to school ( i assume ) . <eos> i had forgotten how hot and muggy it gets here . <eos> it 's almost like walking through soup .

en 2010 je suis allé passer une quinzaine de jours au japon . <eos> j ’ ai donc été dans l ’ incontournable marché au poissons de tsukiji . <eos> marché qui vit ses dernières heures tel qu ’ on le connait puisqu ’ il devrait subir un jour ou l ’ autre ce que les halles parisiennes ont connu avec la relocalisation à rungis . <eos> déjà à l ’ époque , l ’ accès à la criée aux thons n ’ était a priori pas accessible au public . <eos> a terme , le marché ne devrait plus être ouvert qu ’ aux professionnels et depuis mars 2011 l ’ accès est déjà fortement restreint . <eos> j ’ ai pu m ’ y promener durant près de 2h . <eos> il était 10h du matin ce qui est déjà fort tard pour ce marché qui ouvre vers 5h30 . <eos> le gros de la foule , des acheteurs et des produits étaient déjà partis , mais j ’ ai pu assister à quelques scènes intéressantes et y voir de bien jolies choses dans une ambiance très calme et détendue .

the 2011 krewe of harambee martin luther king day mardi gras parade rolled through downtown shreveport on monday , may 17. cold weather did n't keep loads of paradegoers from having a great time and catching lots of fantastic throws . <eos> the highlights of the show were the marching bands , who put on some great performances for the crowd .
rogue wave sets at mauna lani literally cleared the beaches at the fairmont orchid on january 16th ― carrying away lounge chairs and cabanas , and shifting tons of was-sandy shoreline . <eos> i stopped by the day after to see the changes left behind , and found the surf was still unusually high , with only the bravest ( foolish ? ) <eos> bodysurfers familiar with these waters riding the unpredictable sets . <eos> believe it or not , these photos are taken at low tide .

les mains blanches / white hands . <eos> these photos were taken of the mains blanches/white hands protest on the 19th of april 2008 at the htel-de-ville ( town hall ) in paris , france - to denounce the inaction and corruption of those in power & amp ; in support of the hostages held in colombia . <eos> july 2008 saw the rescue of ingrid betancourt and 14 other political hostages by the colombian army from the farc guerrilla forces . <eos> naturally , this was wonderful news to those fighting for the release of all the hostages held in colombia , but there remain close to 2000 people being held in that country . <eos> i would like to believe that the actions of the ordinary citizens who fought to bring the hostages ' plight to the eyes of the world ; made a difference and encouraged those in positions of real power to take action . <eos> of course , more needs to be done to bring a final and positive resolution to the crisis in colombia . <eos> i would like to strongly encourage all those who believe in humanitarian and human rights issues ( whichever they may be ) to take personal action . <eos> of course each individual has varying amounts of time and effort to afford , yet each act counts and is vital . <eos> the day i am writing this is the 19th of january 2009 and is martin luther king day in the u.s. in this world the political , financial and communitarian interests of many of those who hold real power to bring change are counter to the lives of the weakest and the oppressed in our societies - those who want to bring real change need to act together today for a better and more just world . <eos> tomorrow shall always be too late ....

< a href= '' http : //www.cincyfiremuseum.com/firefighting-history '' rel= '' nofollow '' > the history of the fire museum of greater cincinnati < /a > < i > in 1906 , the building that now houses the fire museum of greater cincinnati was home to the engine company # 45 firehouse . <eos> because of this , the fire museum of greater cincinnati is now included in the national register of historic places . <eos> when the building still housed engine company # 45 , cincinnati architect harry hake , sr. ( 1871 to 1955 ) was the chief architect for the cincinnati fire and police departments . <eos> when designing this building , hake used renaissance revival symmetrical design elements and detail ( such as cornices , dentils , half columns , and horizontal stone bands ) to create two distinct facades : the main elevation that faces court street and the other elevation on richmond street that faces city hall . <eos> hake also designed many other distinctive landmarks ( such as the queen city club and the cincinnati bell building ) . <eos> 1802 - cincinnati council passed an ordinance to organize firefighting efforts . <eos> soon after the ordinance was passed , cincinnati created the fire bucket company . <eos> a willow basket about 10 feet long and 6 feet high was placed on four wheels , and this was used to carry leather fire buckets to a fire . <eos> every cincinnati homeowner who paid an annual fee of $ 35 was required to own two blackjack leather fire buckets . <eos> men ages 16 to 50 who did not help with firefighting efforts were charged $ 5 . <eos> men who did not pay this fine were required to spend five days in jail . <eos> 1816 - pumpers replaced buckets . <eos> the people of cincinnati learned that using the hunneman pumper was a more effective way to fight fires than using buckets . <eos> this hand pumper could throw a stream of water up to 133 feet to douse flames quickly . <eos> 1820 - cincinnati implemented its first & quot ; fire hydrant. & quot ; when firefighters arrived to the scene of a fire , they dug for the nearest wooden water pipes . <eos> they made a hole in the pipe to retrieve water . <eos> after the fire was put out , the holes were closed with wooden plugs and marked so they could be used in the future . <eos> sometimes , modern fire hydrants are still called fireplugs . <eos> 1853 - cincinnati established the first full-time , paid , professional fire department . <eos> this fire department used steam fire engines pulled by horses . <eos> these steam fire engines threw a large , powerful stream of water on fires . <eos> then , cincinnati inventors able shawk and alexander latta created & quot ; uncle joe ross , & quot ; the first practical steam fire pumper . <eos> cincinnati became famous throughout the world for its design , development , and manufacturing of firefighting apparatus. < /i >
my visit to chinatown for lunch with a friend on december 30 , 2011. during which i took photos , because i should . <eos> what is currently d.c. 's chinatown area was home to mostly german immigrants until the 1930s . <eos> that 's why the d.c. branch of the goethe-institut is here . <eos> mary surrat , who helped shelter abraham lincoln 's assassins , had her home here at 604 h street nw . <eos> d.c. 's chinatown was established in 1884 , although chinese and other asian immigrants began moving into the area in noticeable numbers as early as 1880. this chinatown existed along the south side of pennsylvania avenue between 4th and 7th streets , with the heaviest concentration of residences and businesses near the center market site where 4th street , c street , and pennsylvania avenue met . <eos> this chinatown existed as a vibrant community until 1935 , when the construction of the national archives building and the apex building ( which houses the federal trade commission ) forced the chinatown to move to its current location on h street nw . <eos> at its peak , the & quot ; new & quot ; chinatown extended from g street north to massachusetts avenue , and from 9th street east to 5th street . <eos> chinatown fell fallen into disrepair after the 1968 martin luther king , jr. assassination riots . <eos> the gallery place metro station serving the neighborhood opened in 1976. in 1986 , the city dedicated the friendship archway , a $ 1 million traditional chinese gate designed by local architect alfred h. liu .

moving into our new home in oakland , ca .
this house was designed by charles pierrepont henry gilbert ( c. p. h. gilbert ) for the new york banker and stockbroker isaac d. fletcher in 1897 and completed in 1898 . <eos> [ 5 ] when fletcher died in 1917 , he left the house and his art collection to the metropolitan museum of art , which sold the house to create the fletcher fund for purchases of prints and drawings . <eos> the purchaser in 1918 was the self-made oil millionaire harry f. sinclair , who lived in the house until 1930. sinclair is best known for founding sinclair oil in 1916 and was made notorious by his involvement in the teapot dome scandal in in 1922. after sinclair sold it in 1930 it became known as the augustus and anne van horne stuyvesant house ; the unmarried brother and sister , descendents of peter stuyvesant , had moved from their house at 3 east 57th street , when that stretch of fifth avenue had become unalterably commercial . <eos> [ 6 ] today , it is owned by the ukrainian institute of america . <eos> in 1996 architectural historian christopher gray quoted an anonymous critic writing for the real estate record & amp ; guide in 1899 , who in praising the design noted that much of the ornament was ecclesiastical in origin rather than domestic . <eos> the writer closed with the observation that the fletcher mansion had & quot ; too much the air of an archeological reproduction to be accepted as an appropriate new york city house of 1898. & quot ; [ 6 ] it was declared a national historic landmark in 1978 [ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] , and remained & quot ; refreshingly unrestored & quot ; , according to christopher gray , until 1997 , when modest renovations were undertaken . <eos> the house was used as a location in the film cruel intentions , as well as many other films and advertisements
sharon jones was born sheron lafaye jones in augusta , georgia on may 4th 1956. her mother moved to brooklyn soon thereafter , however jones was sent down south for a few months every year to stay with her family . <eos> as a child , she and her brothers would imitate the songs and dances of james brown , who shared their hometown . <eos> she began performing in church at a very young age where her voice would find a lifelong home and inspiration . <eos> as a teenager in the early nineteen seventies , she began singing outside of the church in talent shows and with local funk groups . <eos> later she would make her living with a combination of sporadic session work as a mostly anonymous voice on various dance records ( sometimes credited as lafaye jones ) , singing with wedding bands , and a handful of day jobs which included stints as both a prison guard at new york ’ s notorious riker ’ s island , and an armored car guard for wells fargo bank . <eos> in 1996 she was called in to sing back-up at a desco records studio session for 70 ’ s soul legend lee fields.desco was a small independent specializing in traditional funk and soul pressed exclusively to wax . <eos> as the other two girls never showed up for the session , jones cut all the background parts for the session herself , and proceeded to cut the impromptu prison rap over switchblade , which had originally been intended for a man . <eos> ironically , that rant ( slowed down to make it sound like a man ) would be her first outing as a featured artist on a record . <eos> .over the next four years , jones sang frequently alongside lee fields , joseph henry , and naomi davis as part of the desco super soul revue backed by desco house band the soul providers . <eos> desco would release a handful of singles in her name including the bump & amp ; touch , damn it ’ s hot , and you better think twice as well as versions of funk classics i got the feelin ’ and hook & amp ; sling . <eos> guitarist binky griptite , would remain at mann ’ s side as well as organist earl maxton , percussionist fernando ‘ boogaloo ’ velez , trumpeter anda ‘ goodfoot ’ szilagyi and baritone saxophonist jack zapata ( aka martín perna , who would go on to form brooklyn afrobeat collective antibalas ) all from the original soul providers . <eos> from the mighty imperials , a young instrumental organ funk group that recorded at desco , tenor saxophonist leon michels ( who would later leave the group to form the el michels affair as well as his own label , truth & amp ; soul ) and drummer homer ‘ funkyfoot ’ steinweiss would fill out the line-up . <eos> both were only 17 years-old at the time . <eos> now for the first time , the group would be billed as sharon jones ; the dap-kings.in 2001 , dap dippin ’ with sharon jones & amp ; the dap-kings would be jones ’ s first full length recording . <eos> though few hundred copies were pressed to sell on the road , it would take several months and the birth of a new record label before dap-dippin ’ would be commercially released.in late 2001 , saxophonist neal sugarman , whose organ driven sugarman three combo had given desco two of its most prominent releases , and gabriel roth , desco ’ s head recording engineer , joined together to form daptone records . <eos> with the intention of continuing on where desco had left off , daptone ’ s debut release would be the dap-dippin ’ album.over the next three years , sharon jones & amp ; the dap-kings would tour extensively and build steadily upon a growing reputation as the unrivaled frontrunners of old-school soul and funk music . <eos> the trumpet chair passed from szilagyi to todd simon , and was eventually filled by david guy . <eos> maxton left the band in 2003 to play with antibalas , leaving the band with no organ , and guitarist tommy ‘ tnt ’ brenneck , of the budos band , would take up the slack in the rhythm section.by the time they returned to the studio in 2004 , the dap-kings roster read like a veritable who ’ s who of the day ’ s soul and funk scene , most of whom were bandleaders in their own right . <eos> countless gigs had molded the rhythm section into a redoubtable juggernaut on the bandstand , and the combination of sugarman , guy , and hendrickson-smith in the horn section was fierce . <eos> behind the ever-increasing power and stage presence of jones , the band was becoming a force to be reckoned with.in 2003 , daptone records had relocated to a dilapidated two family house in bushwick , brooklyn . <eos> naturally hit the streets and set jones and the dap-kings loose on a relentless touring schedule . <eos> fueled by rave reviews of both their new record and the blistering live show , record sales and concert attendance began rising across the country , and as the band began to tour more frequently overseas , international markets soon followed suit . <eos> by 2006 , audiences in europe , canada , and australia were packing venues to see sharon jones & amp ; the dap-kings.a high point came when daptone records presented a soul revue at new york ’ s irving plaza ( fillmore east ) to honor jones ’ 50th birthday .

leave it to jean-luc godard and anne marie miéville to figure out how to use television to reveal the latent brilliance of a child . <eos> created for french television during the radical days of the late 1970s , “ france/tour/detour/deux enfant ” ( 1978 ) is an intimate , provocative and quotidian video essay that uses avant-garde cinema ’ s techniques in a visual experiment that will change anyone ’ s perception of the developing mind of a human being . <eos> tonight lynne sachs will discuss the way that “ france/tour… ” influenced her own work as she reflects on the presence of childhood in her twenty-year film career . <eos> beginning in her early twenties when the ambiguity of femininity seemed daunting and problematic to more recent years when motherhood has given her quick access to the conundrums of youth , sachs , like godard and melville , ponders her relationship as an artist to this unavoidable eighteen year odyssey . <eos> sachs will screen photograph of wind ( 3 min. , 2001 ) , atalanta : 32 years later ( 5 min . <eos> 2006 ) , and the last happy day ( 38 min . ) <eos> in their entirety along with brief scenes from the house of science ( 1991 ) and wind in our hair ( 2010 ) . <eos> program : france/tour/detour/deux enfants by jean luc godard and ann marie miéville ( excerpt from 12 part tv series , 1977 , france ) godard and miéville take a detour through the everyday lives of two children in contemporary france . <eos> sachs will present excerpts from the series . <eos> photograph of wind by lynne sachs ( 4 min.,16mm , b & amp ; w and color , 2001 ) “ my daughter ’ s name is maya . <eos> i ’ ve been told that the word maya means illusion in hindu philosophy . <eos> as i watch her growing up , spinning like a top around me , i realize that her childhood is not something i can grasp but rather C like the wind C something i feel tenderly brushing across my cheek. ” ( lynne sachs ) “ sachs suspends in time a single moment of her daughter. ” fred camper , chicago reader atalanta : 32 years later by lynne sachs ( 5 min . <eos> color sound , 16mm to video , 2006 ) a retelling of the age-old fairy tale of the beautiful princess in search of the perfect prince . <eos> in 1974 , marlo thomas ’ hip , liberal celebrity gang created a feminist version of the children ’ s parable for mainstream tv ’ s “ free to be you and me ” . <eos> now in 2006 , sachs dreamed up this new experimental film reworking , a homage to girl/girl romance . <eos> “ very gentle and evocative of foreign feelings. ” george kuchar the last happy day by lynne sachs ( 38 min . <eos> 2009 ) the last happy day is an experimental documentary portrait of sandor ( alexander ) lenard , a hungarian medical doctor and a distant cousin of filmmaker lynne sachs . <eos> in 1938 lenard , a writer with a jewish background , fled the nazis to a safe haven in rome . <eos> shortly thereafter , the u.s. army graves registration service hired lenard to reconstruct the bones ― small and large ― of dead american soldiers . <eos> eventually he found himself in remotest brazil where he embarked on the translation of “ winnie the pooh ” into latin , an eccentric task that catapulted him to brief world-wide fame . <eos> sachs ’ essay film uses personal letters , abstracted war imagery , home movies , interviews , and a children ’ s performance to create an intimate meditation on the destructive power of war . <eos> “ a fascinating , unconventional approach to a holocaust-related story … a frequently charming work that makes no effort to disguise an underlying melancholy. ” george robinson , the jewish week excerpts from : the house of science : a museum of false facts ( 30 min. , 16mm,1991 ) “ throughout the house of science an image of a woman , her brain revealed , is a leitmotif . <eos> it suggests that the mind/body split so characteristic of western thought is particularly troubling for women , who may feel themselves moving between the territories of the film ’ s title Chouse , science , and museum , or private , public and idealized space ― without wholly inhabiting any of them . <eos> this film explores society ’ s representation and conceptualization of women through home movies , personal reminiscences , staged scenes , found footage and voice . <eos> sachs ’ personal memories recall the sense of her body being divided , whether into sexual and functional territories , or ‘ the body of the body ’ and ‘ the body of the mind. ’ ” ( kathy geritz , pacific film archive ) wind in our hair/con viento en el pelo ( 16mm , super 8 and digital on video , english and spanish , 2010 ) “ inspired by the writings of julio cortázar , whose work not only influenced a generation of latin american writers but film directors such as antonioni and godard , lynne sachs ’ wind in our hair/con viento en el pelo is an experimental narrative that explores the interior and exterior worlds of four early-teens , and how through play they come to discover themselves and their world . <eos> “ freedom takes us by the handCit seizes the whole of our bodies , ” a young narrator describes as they head towards the tracks . <eos> this is their kingdom , a place whereCdawning fanciful masks , feather boas , and colorful scarves ― the girls pose as statues and perform for each other and for passengers speeding by. ” - carolyn tennant , media arts director , hallwalls contemporary arts center , buffalo , new york “ wind in our hair moves from childhood ’ s earthbound , cloistered spaces , into the skittering beyond of adolescence , exploding with anticipation and possibility. ” todd lillethun , artistic director , chicago filmmakers program run time : 119 minutes lynne sachs makes films , videos , installations and web projects that explore the intricate relationship between personal observations and broader historical experiences by weaving together poetry , collage , painting , politics and layered sound design . <eos> since 1994 , her five essay films have taken her to vietnam , bosnia , israel and germany ― sites affected by international warCwhere she tries to work in the space between a community ’ s collective memory and her own subjective perceptions . <eos> strongly committed to a dialogue between cinematic theory and practice , lynne searches for a rigorous play between image and sound , pushing the visual and aural textures in her work with each and every new project . <eos> since 2006 , she has collaborated with her partner mark street in a series of playful , mixed-media performance collaborations they call the xy chromosome project . <eos> in addition to her work with the moving image , lynne co-edited the 2009 millennium film journal issue on “ experiments in documentary ” . <eos> supported by fellowships from the rockefeller and jerome foundations and the new york state council on the arts , lynne ’ s films have screened at the museum of modern art , the new york film festival , the sundance film festival and recently in a five film survey at the buenos aires film festival . <eos> in 2010 , the san francisco cinematheque will present a full retrospective of her work . <eos> lynne teaches experimental film and video at new york university and lives in brooklyn . <eos> josetxo cerdán los arcos is an assistant professor at the urv and the

< strong > palais omnisport de paris bercy , le 2 mars 2008 < /strong > from : < a href= '' http : //www.juste-debout.com/apropos.php '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.juste-debout.com/apropos.php < /a > < i > < b >  < /b > < strong > the idea < /strong > hip hop dance has a different impact on people . <eos> until then , there was no event presenting the various styles of dance : popping , locking , hip hop new style and house dance ... that ’ s why , in 2001 , bruce ykanji , lover of the dance for a long time , and the mpt victor jara , led in that time by pascal gilbert , decided to organize a journey of perfection in new york . <eos> the idea was to reward 5 better students of classes . <eos> the classes were taught by three great us dancers and choreographers : brian green , shannon mabra et jazzy j. in 2002 , the organizers did it again , but this time , by making the americans come in france . <eos> the purpose was not only to touch more people , but to allow people who couldn ’ t afford move to us to see great names of hip hop dance and by that way , to develop hip hop dance in france . <eos> “ juste debout ” was born . <eos> < strong > what is exactly the “ juste debout ” ? < /strong > the “ juste debout “ divides in two : on one hand , the training , supervised by the foreign speakers ( or judges ) and on the other hand , the meeting which is judged by the same speakers . <eos> - the training takes place over a week . <eos> it ’ s the occasion for bruce ykanji , the mpt victor jara and the social center georges brassens to collect some 150 young people coming from all the social classes of france and moreover . <eos> - the meeting or “ battle ” , extends over a day during which more than 80 dancers are going to be in confrontation , in a cool spirit ( it ’ s for that reason that the organizers prefer the term “ meeting ” to that of “ battle “ ) , in front of a jury of recognized professionals of the whole world . <eos> a good reason for thedancers to give the best of themselves . <eos> “ juste debout “ is the result of many years of hard work and not , as many could think , one of these fashionable events . <eos> this is not a contest , a competition : it ’ s the essence of hip hop dance ! <eos> < b >  < /b > < /i >

hidcote manor garden is one of england 's great gardens . <eos> it was the life 's passion of one man , self-taught gardener lawrence johnston who created his 'garden of rooms ' here . <eos> the creator of hidcote lawrence johnston was born in paris of american parents . <eos> he came to england to study at cambridge university . <eos> after graduating , he fought for the british army . <eos> he was so badly wounded in the first world war that he was laid out for burial . <eos> his colleagues realised that he was still alive only after he moved slightly . <eos> in 1907 , johnston 's mother , mrs gertrude winthrop , bought the hidcote manor estate . <eos> johnston came to live at hidcote and soon took to gardening . <eos> developing a masterpiece johnston spent 41 years creating what would become one of england 's most influential 20th-century gardens . <eos> he began work in 1907 , becoming interested in making a garden out of the fields surrounding the house . <eos> the garden was developed in the fashionable arts & amp ; crafts style : a series of outdoor 'rooms ' offering surprises and discoveries at each turn . <eos> by the 1920s , the transformation was well under way . <eos> johnston employed 12 full-time gardeners to help shape his 10-acre creation . <eos> he always took advice and read extensively on the work of eminent gardeners , such as gertrude jekyll . <eos> ' a garden of rooms' johnston designed hidcote as a series of outdoor 'rooms ' , which combine sensuous masses of colour with traditional garden crafts such as topiary . <eos> each room has its own distinct atmosphere and character . <eos> the hedges that divide the rooms sprung up due to the plot 's exposed aspect . <eos> johnston planted hedges of holly , beech , hornbeam and yew for shelter and structure . <eos> exotic plants as well as a gardener , lawrence johnston was an accomplished plantsman . <eos> the range of plants he used was huge . <eos> in a never-ending quest , he secured rare and exotic species by sponsoring and taking part in plant hunting expeditions . <eos> trips took him to the alps , kenya and south africa . <eos> he also plant-swapped with the australians and the japanese . <eos> the expeditions introduced over 40 new plants to cultivation in the uk , many of which bear johnston 's name . <eos> he was awarded three awards of merit by the royal horticultural society for his plant hunting achievements . <eos> the national trust learns to garden in 1948 , lawrence johnston retired to serre de la madone , his home on the french riviera where he had created another spectacular garden . <eos> hidcote manor garden came to the national trust , the first property acquired specifically for the garden . <eos> while carrying forward the spirit of lawrence johnston , hidcote has changed over time since the 1930s . <eos> lack of funding has led to areas of the garden becoming overgrown and many of johnston 's tender plants being replaced . <eos> 'this place is a jungle of beauty . <eos> i can not hope to describe it in words , for indeed it is an impossible thing to reproduce the shape , colour , depth and design of such a garden through the poor medium of prose' - vita sackville-west for more information about hidcote manor garden , please visit < a href= '' http : //www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hidcote/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hidcote/ < /a >

the recorder of deeds building , which houses the city 's land records , is one of the city 's art deco/art moderne landmarks . <eos> designed by architect nathan c. wyeth , it was completed in 1941. congress created the office of recorder of deeds in 1863 , and in 1869 this city agency was given the job of “ recording all deeds , contracts , and other instruments in writing affecting the title or ownership of any real estate or personal property ” in the city . <eos> the holders of this job have been appointed by u.s. presidents . <eos> african americans have served as recorders of deeds ( and in most staff positions ) for washington , dc , since president james a. garfield appointed frederick douglass in 1881. ten other african americans succeeded douglass . <eos> elocutionist henrietta vinton davis ( 1860-1941 ) became the first black woman employed in the office in 1878 , later serving as douglass 's assistant . <eos> the building is distinguished by a series of seven works projects administration era murals on the theme of “ the contribution of the negro to the american nation , ” including the 54th massachusetts regiment , astronomer benjamin banneker , and explorer matthew a. henson . <eos> noted sculptor and teacher selma burke ( 1900-1995 ) also created a bronze relief of president franklin d. roosevelt in profile . <eos> burke believed , as do many others , that this portrait is the basis for the john sinnick engraving of roosevelt on the u.s. dime .

michael made his signature prime rib for a new year 's feast !
every spring and every fall , a street fair magically appears along a one-mile stretch of broadway in our neighborhood . <eos> i do n't know where the vendors come from , or where they store their booths and supplies ; i have visions of them camped in squalid tents somewhere in the wilderness of new jersey for the rest of the year , anxiously counting the days until they can invade the city once again . <eos> as i discovered on a billboard placed on the street at this year 's fair , the vendors sneak quietly from one neighborhood to another in the middle of the night throughout the spring and fall , from manhattan to queens , brooklyn , bronx , and staten island . <eos> anyway , i 've dutifully photographed the fairs for the past several years ; if you 're interested , here 's the < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/collections/72157605593313075/ '' > flickr collection < /a > for the fairs that i 've photographed over the past five years . <eos> it 's always the same : colorful , hand-made baskets from central america , cheap socks , scented candles , specialty soaps , sunglasses , trinkets , and t-shirts . <eos> booths selling reggae music , discount subscriptions to the < i > new york times < /i > and < i > daily news < /i > , and chiropractors earnestly telling passers-by how they can make anyone 's back feel good once again . <eos> volunteer organizations beseeching tourists and residents for donations to some worthy cause , and a few street musicians making a racket with their over-amplified music . <eos> and then there 's the food : gyros , sausage , candy apples , souvlaki , corn on the cob , lemonade , french crepes , hot dogs , calzone , funnel cake , zeppoles , shish kebab , pickles , olives , french fries , onion rings , spring rolls , and thai food . <eos> for several , we were spared the fried twinkies , deep-fried oreo cookies , another such greasy atrocities -- but the oreo cookies have now appeared , and i 'm sure the rest will soon follow . <eos> just like the fair that i photographed last fall , it was all so & quot ; deja vu all over again & quot ; that i just could n't be bothered to photograph any of the food stands . <eos> the only thing that does change , year after year , is the assortment of people . <eos> so i set my camera to increase the likelihood of getting some decent & quot ; hip shots & quot ; ( basically just a high iso setting of 400 to 1,600 , depending on the extent of sunlight during the afternoon , to force the auto-exposure mechanism to shoot at fast shutter speeds of approx 1/400 second ) , and just wandered along the street , pointing the camera at anyone that looked interesting . <eos> i took 500+ photos , and ended up with about 20 that looked reasonably interesting ...
happy new year guise .
a few minutes walk from my home are the twin cemeteries of edmonton and st. joachim . <eos> the cemeteries are divided by 107th avenue here in edmonton , alberta . <eos> both cemeteries date from the late 19th century . <eos> having living close to them for more than 20 years and having walked through them umpteen times i thought maybe i should take my camera , so i did . <eos> this set is a start to many more i will add over time . <eos> many famous edmontonians are buried here .

i thought this was a cooper 's hawk at first , but now think it was a sharp-shinned hawk . <eos> we had just finished our new year 's day dinner and the people who smoke went out in the backyard to smoke , and one of them noticed this fella finishing his own dinner on our back fence . <eos> we scrambled to grab a camera . <eos> we were about 40 feet away and did n't want to scare him off . <eos> my camera could n't zoom in near enough , so gary grabbed his new nikon d300 . <eos> we 're in low light and had no tripod , but were braced against a wall . <eos> very disappointed that the camera did n't do a little better . <eos> but still - we 've got proof he was there . <eos> it 's a bit rare to see these guys in the middle of the city . <eos> never had one as a guest in my back yard before .

hamtramck was the location for the region 1 education seminar held on friday , may 6th . <eos> local officials from across southeast michigan gathered on what was to be the start of a beautiful spring weekend . <eos> read more here ( http : //www.mml.org/events/blog/post/hamtramck-hosts-region-1-meeting-the-second-stop-on-the-mml-tour.aspx ) the meeting was opened with a welcome by hamtramck mayor and league vice-president karen majewski , who welcomed all the participants to what , is surely one of the most diverse communities in michigan . <eos> that was followed by a presentation by league ceo and executive director dan gilmartin on the political climate in lansing . <eos> that issue was also addressed by alpena mayor and league president carol shafto during the lunch . <eos> league associate executive director and coo , tony minghine , followed the luncheon with a discussion on current trends and issues in municipal finance . <eos> and league legislative associate , samantha harkins finished the day with a legislative update that featured a question and answer session with former league president 's and now state representatives , vicki barnett of farmington hills and woodrow stanley of flint . <eos> of course , a region meeting would n't be complete with presentations for the league 's community excellence award . <eos> and , after a initial three-way tie , southfield 's field zone won the day . <eos> view the press release ( http : //www.mml.org/newsroom/press_releases/2011-5-11-region1-cea.html ) and blog post ( http : //www.mml.org/events/blog/post/southfields-field-zone-youth-center-wins-region-1-community-excellence-award.aspx ) on this and the other entries at region 1. after a initial three-way tie ( a first in cea history ) , southfield 's 'field zone youth center came away the winner of the region 1 community excellence award . <eos> the region 1 meeting was held in hamtramck on friday , may 6th . <eos> given the competition , it was n't too hard to understand why a run-off was needed . <eos> four total projects were presented . <eos> the city of brighton showcased a downtown development project where decisions on converting a former bank led to $ 4 million in investment including a new park and mixed-use development . <eos> farmington hills showed how sustainability efforts in construction of a new city hall have led to a gold leed certification and $ 27 monthly electric bills . <eos> and sterling heights proved how collaboration between local , and regional business and civic leaders , and the state , led to keeping the doors open on a assembly plant that was a major economic driver . <eos> but it was southfield 's 'field zone youth center that won the day . <eos> the center is a collaborative effort that provides a place for youth , after school , to showcase their talent in leadership , recreation , creativity , community involvement , academics , technology , arts , and music . <eos> this center is quickly becoming the 'hub ' of community activity , and is open to middle school and high school students , who reside in or attend the city of southfield and lathrup village schools . <eos> congratulations to southfield and 'field zone as they compete for the cea cup at the league 's annual convention this october 4-7 in grand rapids ! <eos> register for convention ( http : //www.mml.org/events/annual_convention/index.html ) on-line beginning june 1. be sure to catch this year 's & quot ; mml tour & quot ; at regional meetings across the state this spring. . for more on the mml tour go here : < a href= '' http : //www.mml.org/events/mmltour/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.mml.org/events/mmltour/ < /a > ; and on twitter at # mmltour . <eos> the regional meetings give michigan municipal league members a chance to hear from league staff and state officials about the latest municipal-related legislation in lansing and ways communities are becoming the types of areas where people want to live , work and play . <eos> the league is still accepting registrations from members for upcoming regional meetings ludington ( may 11 ) , marine city ( may 18 ) , east lansing ( may 20 ) , houghton ( may 26-27 ) and saginaw ( june 1 ) . <eos> view the full regional schedule here . <eos> for more about the league and what we do go to mml.org . <eos> for more on the tour go to tour.mml.org .

for musically talented barossa valley local , sam brittain , story-telling is exactly that . <eos> since releasing his debut lp ‘ our shining skin ’ on june 1 , 2012 , the path to success for the gifted and independent musician has transformed into a never-ending road . <eos> first picking up a guitar at the age of three and additionally turning his hand to the piano and drums , in 2013 , sam is an unstoppable , roots , folk and blues artist , reminiscent of sounds such as damien rice , glen hansard and ryan adams . <eos> sam supported close friend and musical influence , mike rosenberg ( passenger ) at adelaide-based fowlers live , as an integral part of mike ’ s ‘ all the little lights ’ album tour , a highlight of sam ’ s career to date . <eos> the recording of ‘ our shining skin ’ saw sam and his band work endlessly with the talented barossa-based jamie blechynden of stella studios and vj productions . <eos> supported by bj barker ( drums ) , steve flemming ( bass ) and glen wagland ( engineer ) , tracking the backbone of all 12 songs took a mere two days to complete . <eos> ‘ our shining skin ’ quickly earned impressive reviews and was labelled as a ‘ formidable and wide spreading resume ’ for sam ( timber and steel , august , 2012 ) . <eos> kicking off an australian tour , sam officially released the highly anticipated album at a sold out show on june 9 , 2012 , held at the chateau ’ s acoustically brilliant ‘ long room ’ . <eos> in june and july 2012 , sam crossed the country , delighting crowds and building his fan base in melbourne , hobart , darwin and adelaide , including an unforgettable sold out show with sam ’ s full band at the prominent adelaide venue , the promethean theatre on september 27 , 2012. marking the beginning of what ’ s set to be a milestone year and following a hugely successful first tour , sam ’ s lead single ‘ bruises ’ hit # 1 on the triple j unearthed roots chart on new year ’ s eve , 2012/13 , where it consolidated its lead for a consecutive four weeks , peaking at # 6 in the overall top 100 . <eos> 2013 saw sam embark on a 16 date tour once again supporting new age folk music legend mike rosenberg ( passenger ) .

war horse play enjoys sydney , australia media call at lyric theatre , the star this morning war horse ( the play - not the movie ) , enjoyed its sydney media / production call . <eos> it might have been a touch low on media attendance , but was high on talent , passion , and quality all around . <eos> this thursday war horse will enjoy much more media attention with its sydney red carpet premiere , however the music news australia and media man team were happy to get a leg up on the competition by getting an early look in at this world class production . <eos> the acting , production , props and every other element certainly had a 5 star look and feel to it . <eos> it 's little wonder media and audiences have been raving about the production the world over . <eos> media quotes ... “ war horse is extraordinary theatre . <eos> brilliant , bold , moving , it is a world-class fusion of performance , design and specially puppetry. ” the age “ epic… magnificent… impressive . <eos> you can almost smell the sweat and leather and hear the galloping hooves of their magnificent “ animals ” manipulated by master puppeteers. ” - herald sun “ outstanding . <eos> the production confidently says : come along for the ride. ” - the australian “ unique and breathtaking theatre. ” - radio national “ truly a spectacle that you have to experience. ” - 3aw & quot ; everything about war horse looks to be 5 stars . <eos> the overall production , acting , consuming , the animal robotics . <eos> the interaction between the actors , the horses and the audience is amazing and has to be experienced to be believed . <eos> this version of war horse is just as satisfying as the movie - maybe more so in some regards . <eos> this may just be the best play to hit australia this year . <eos> highly recommended - greg tingle , media director - media man . <eos> the guardian 's michael billington wrote in his review : elliott and morris recreate the kaleidoscopic horror of war through bold imagery , including the remorseless advance of a manually operated tank , and through the line-drawings of rae smith projected on to a suspended screen . <eos> admittedly the performers are somewhat eclipsed by the action ... the joy of the evening , however , lies in the skilled recreation of equine life and in its unshaken belief that mankind is ennobled by its love of the horse . <eos> charles spencer in the daily telegraph had written that , generally , & quot ; puppets are often an embarrassment , involving a lot of effort and fuss for negligible returns & quot ; ; in this case , he praised the puppetry as & quot ; truly magnificent creations by the handspring puppet company. & quot ; the times ' 10-year-old guest reviewer called the show & quot ; movingly and realistically brought to life & quot ; and & quot ; an emotional and compelling adaptation of the book. & quot ; in reviewing the broadway production , ben brantley wrote in the new york times , & quot ; ... it is how joey is summoned into being , along with an assortment of other animals , that gives this production its ineffably theatrical magic ... beautifully designed by rae smith ... and paule constable , this production is also steeped in boilerplate sentimentality . <eos> beneath its exquisite visual surface , it keeps pushing buttons like a sales clerk in a notions shop. & quot ; brantley suggests , & quot ; the implicit plea not to be forgotten applies not just to the villagers , soldiers and horses portrayed here , but also to theater , as an evanescent art that lives on only in audiences ’ memories . <eos> judged by that standard , much of war horse evaporates not long after it ends . <eos> but i would wager that for a good while , you ’ ll continue to see joey in your dreams. & quot ; entertainment weekly gave a positive review , calling the show an & quot ; imaginative , moving new broadway drama ... the play 's equine stars are the remarkable creation of adrian kohler and basil jones ' handspring puppet company . <eos> as manipulated by three handlers dressed in period costumes , the life-size creatures seem to breathe , snort , feed , walk , gallop , and rear up just as naturally as the genuine articles . <eos> in no time at all , they become characters as rounded and complex as any of the humans on stage. & quot ; time magazine ranked the play as its top choice among all theatre productions in 2011. the wall street journal 's terry teachout praised the puppetry , but gave mixed reactions to the play : & quot ; the fundamental flaw of 'war horse ' is that nick stafford , who wrote the script 'in association ' ( that 's how the credit reads ) with south africa 's handspring puppet company , has taken a book that was written for children and tried to give it the expressive weight of a play for adults . <eos> not surprisingly , mr. morpurgo 's plot ca n't stand the strain . <eos> dramatic situations that work perfectly well in the context of the book play like hollywood clichés onstage . <eos> in the first act , the craftsmanship is so exquisite that this does n't matter―much―but things go downhill fast after intermission . <eos> the really big problem is the last scene , about which , once again , the drama critics ' code commands silence . <eos> this much must be said , though : a play that is so forthright about the horrors of war owes its audience a more honest ending. & quot ; theatre review aggregator curtain critic gave the production a score of 88 out of 100 based on the opinions of 21 critics . <eos> war horse media release : internationally acclaimed critical and box office hit war horse ... the national theatre of great britain and global creatures are proud to bring the multiple tony and olivier award-winning war horse , to australia . <eos> applauded by critics and audiences alike , war horse held its australian premiere in melbourne on new year ’ s eve at arts centre melbourne ’ s state theatre . <eos> after the melbourne season war horse will travel to sydney for a season at the sydney lyric from saturday 16 march , 2013 and to brisbane for a season at lyric theatre from saturday 6 july , 2013. since its world premiere in london in 2007 , war horse has won numerous prestigious awards including two laurence olivier awards , five tony awards and four outer critics ’ circle awards amongst a host of others . <eos> the handspring puppet company has also won many accolades including a 2011 special tony award . <eos> “ the anzac spirit is deeply entrenched in the australian ethos . <eos> we expect war horse to have a great resonance in this country not only because of our connection to world war i but because themes of the land , loss and the ultimate triumph of friendship have a special place in the australian psyche . <eos> we are proud to produce this highly acclaimed show with the national theatre. ” says carmen pavlovic , ceo of global creatures . <eos> nick stafford ’ s stage adaptation of michael morpurgo ’ s book , war horse is a magnificent drama which tells the heart wrenching story of joey , the beloved horse of a boy called albert , who is sold to the cavalry at the outbreak of world war i and shipped to france . <eos> he ’ s soon caught up in enemy fire , and fate takes him on an extraordinary odyssey , serving on both sides before finding himself alone in no man ’ s land . <eos> but albert can not forget joey and , still not old enough to enlist , he embarks on a treacherous mission to find him and bring him home . <eos> at its heart are astonishing puppets strong enough for men to ride , created by south africa ’ s handspring puppet company , who bring breathing , galloping , charging horses to life on the stage . <eos> life size horses traverse the stage , their flanks , hides and sinews built of steel , leather and aircraft cables . <eos> actors , working with these dynamic puppets , will lead australian audiences on an emotionally-charged journey through history . <eos> & quot ; war horse is a life affirming story about friendship , courage and family , which appeals to all ages . <eos> this is a production that brings the family together , we get people coming back again and again , and they always have the same reaction . <eos> it awakens something in you , ” says chris harper , producer , national theatre of great britain . <eos> war horse has played to packed houses at london ’ s national theatre , the west end ’ s new london theatre and new york ’ s vivian beaumont theater at lincoln center . <eos> a further production opened in toronto , canada in february 2012 and a us tour commenced in june 2012. steven spielberg ’ s movie adaptation of michael morpurgo ’ s novel , released by dreamworks studios in late 2011 , was nominated for six academy awards including best picture . <eos> directed by marianne elliott and tom morris , war horse is designed by rae smith , with puppet design and fabrication by basil jones and adrian kohler for handspring puppet company , lighting by paule constable , and movement and horse choreography by toby sedgwick ; the puppetry directors are basil jones and adrian kohler , with video design by leo warner and mark grimmer , songmaker john tams , music by adrian sutton and sound by christopher shutt . <eos> websites lyric theatre , sydney - war horse < a href= '' http : //www.sydneylyric.com.au/index.php/whats-on/current-show/war-horse '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.sydneylyric.com.au/index.php/whats-on/current-show/wa ... < /a > lyric theatre , sydney < a href= '' http : //www.sydneylyric.com.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.sydneylyric.com.au < /a > war horse on stage official website < a href= '' http : //www.warhorseonstage.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.warhorseonstage.com < /a > the star < a href= '' http : //www.star.com.au '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.star.com.au < /a > media man int < a href= '' http : //www.mediamanint.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.mediamanint.com < /a > eva rinaldi photography < a href= '' http : //www.evarinaldi.com '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.evarinaldi.com < /a >

this collection of photos is somewhat of a disappointment : i had expected to find a somewhat more exotic , colorful collection of tourists and pedestrians in times square . <eos> it was lunchtime on a nice , sunny saturday in mid-august , so there were plenty of people wandering around ... but most of them seemed so reasonable and & quot ; ordinary & quot ; that i just left them alone . <eos> on the other hand , i only stayed here for half an hour ; if i had been persistent enough to hang around all day , i probably would have gotten several more brief glimpses at truly unusual people ...

< i > christiana care health system rolls out electronic computerized provider order entry < /i > christiana care health system is taking a giant leap forward toward a comprehensive electronic health record with the launch of computerized provider order entry ( cpoe ) , technology that makes it easier , more efficient and safer for doctors to order tests and medications . <eos> the system went live on jan. 28 at christiana care ’ s wilmington hospital and in coming weeks will go live at its other hospital , christiana hospital . <eos> it will be the most extensive use of cpoe in delaware and one of only a handful in the region . <eos> “ cpoe transforms the way we provide care to our patients because it emphasizes patient safety by dramatically reducing the risk of medication and order entry errors , ” says terri steinberg , m.d. , mba , christiana care ’ s chief medical information officer . <eos> “ it also helps doctors to be more efficient in patient care. ” with bar-coded wristbands and an electronic medication administration record ( emar ) system already in place , christiana care joins a small and elite group . <eos> according to healthcare information and management systems society ( himss ) standards , the addition of cpoe puts christiana care in the top 3.6 percent of hospitals in the united states . <eos> more important , that means christiana care is nearing its ultimate goal of establishing a comprehensive electronic health record system . <eos> the government ’ s mandate is for hospitals to increase use of ehr from 10 percent in 2009 to 55 percent by 2014. cpoe provides real-time patient identification and data on allergies and drug reactions . <eos> doctors and nurses can review orders for confirmation immediately , streamlining delivery to the patient . <eos> on average , patients go home from the hospital sooner , reducing costs , according to a harvard medical school study . <eos> the technology reduces repeat tests and turnaround times for results , as well as glitches associated with paper such as incomplete charts . <eos> because health care providers enter orders electronically , the system eliminates errors in deciphering doctors ’ handwriting . <eos> cpoe also provides such conveniences as “ smart med ” pick lists , with usual doses and methods of delivery . <eos> it is equipped with hundreds of order sets for the most common diagnoses . <eos> doctors ultimately will benefit from cpoe because they can write orders from their homes or offices . <eos> they also will receive fewer return calls from the lab and pharmacy to clarify orders .

a couple weeks ago , i arrived about an hour early for a photography class at the international center for photography ( icp ) in mid-town manhattan . <eos> knowing that i 'd have some time available , i was planning to wander through bryant park ( behind the new york public library ) to see if there was anything interesting to photograph . <eos> but there was a massive construction project underway ( the details of which i still have n't figured out ) , occupying almost all of the block-square park area . <eos> it was also bitter cold , and the sun had dropped behind the office buildings on the west side of the park , casting everything into gloom and shadow ... so there were almost no people at all in the park area , and really nothing at all worth photographing . <eos> so i decided instead to get a cup of hot chocolate at a tiny coffee/snack stand near the northwest corner of the park , and simply park myself at one of the outdoor tables near the corner , to see what kind of people might wander by . <eos> specifically , i was at the southeast corner of 42nd street and avenue of the americas ; and it was about 5 pm , so the after-work commuter rush was well underway . <eos> buses , taxis , and cars were moving rapidly up the avenue , and back and forth along 42nd street -- with drivers honking madly , slamming on their brakes , and revving their motors to vent their frustrations . <eos> commuters , workers , students , and tourists ( judging from their accents ) -- as well as a few haggard people who looked homeless and cold -- were dashing west towards times square , east towards grand central , and north/south towards ... well , who knows where . <eos> because of the shadows and gloom , i had to turn the iso setting on my d300 up to 3200 ; but that made it possible to capture most people without a flash , and without too much blurriness . <eos> i took a little over a hundred photos , and ended up with the 10 that i 've collected into this flickr set . <eos> i do n't know if i can say that this collection is a truly & quot ; representative & quot ; set of new yorkers ( and visitor/tourists ) ... but it 's at least one & quot ; snapshot & quot ; that will give you a rough idea of what it 's like at the end of the work-day on a cold winter 's afternoon .

poster art mobilized the nation . <eos> images on factory bulletin boards , store windows , and billboards warned against complacency , inspired patriotism , and called for sacrifice from every citizen . <eos> this image , the most popular poster design of world war ii , appeared as a billboard in 1941. it was prepared by commercial artist carl paulson under the direction of the outdoor advertising association of america , inc. , for the u.s. treasury department 's campaign promoting the widespread public ownership of defense bonds and stamps . <eos> after the u.s. entry into the war on december 8 , 1941 , the words on this flag poster changed from & quot ; defense & quot ; to & quot ; war & quot ; bonds . <eos> to demonstrate the power of advertising while selling treasury bonds , the billboard industry displayed this image at more than 30,000 locations in some 18,000 cities and towns across the country in march and april 1942. it was brought back for campaigns in july 1942 and 1943. to meet public demand for copies of the billboard , the government printing office printed 4 million smnall color reproductions . <eos> gift of the u.s. treasury department billboard section division of political history collection

< a href= '' http : //www.facebook.com/usaghumphreys '' rel= '' nofollow '' > learn more < /a > by steven hoover steve.hoover @ us.army.mil camp humphreys C a children ’ s play area , which has been dubbed “ super park , ” and features equipment that allows children of all abilities to use the play place , was officially opened here nov. 30. due to inclement weather , the ceremony was moved into the super gym , where about 40 children from the child development center ’ s strong beginnings classes recited the pledge of allegiance and then sang “ god bless america , ” before participating in the ribbon cutting . <eos> the “ inclusive design ” of the equipment makes it easier for all children to use the equipment and , according to officials , was the primary reason the contract was awarded to playworld systems . <eos> this company has built similar playgrounds at fort gordon , ga. , fort sill , okla. , eielson air force base , alaska , and yokota air base , japan . <eos> the park , which was built here , essentially , with money the garrison was awarded during the 2009 army communities of excellence program , is located adjacent to the super gym parking garage and cost roughly $ 493,000 . <eos> acoe is a program for the total army which focuses on improvements in the environment , in services and facilities , improving working and living conditions , renewing pride and developing a sense of accomplishment in every member of the community . <eos> the u.s. army garrison humphreys directorate of public works ’ master planning division created the super park concept in conjunction with the directorate of family , morale , and welfare . <eos> “ it was extremely challenging to find a location not affected by the ongoing transformation , ” said dennis polaski , director of dpw . <eos> “ this opportunity became available when it was determined that a future satellite post office , originally sited in the location , would not fit and had to be relocated . <eos> with more than 85 percent of the garrison families residing off-post , this new park is a significant quality of life improvement at camp humphreys. ” polaski credits suzanne james , director of the camp humphrey army community services , with “ being responsible for bringing this vision and concept to reality. ” jayme stelker , a camp humphreys family member and the mother of three , said “ the new park is awesome . <eos> thanks. ” the playground equipment is divided into play areas for ages 2-5 and then ages 5-12. among other things , it provides accessible routes into , around and within the play space , makes all ground-level activities accessible and is intended to create an identical or equivalent play experience for every child . <eos> also included are two pavilions , playground equipment , picnic tables and benches . <eos> in the spring , grills will be added . <eos> the pavilions can be reserved and rented through fmwr ’ s outdoor recreation , located in bldg . <eos> s-1044 , which is behind the super gym parking garage . <eos> the number to call is 753-3013. u.s. army photos by steven hoover

june 2 , 2010 - the city of burien begins cleanup activities at the former b/ias site in preparation for the upcoming wild strawberry festival .
gangapur , nashik is located in the northwestern part of the maharashtra province of india , 180 km from mumbai and 202 km from pune . <eos> nirmal gram nirman kendra ( ngnk ) , a local ngo , undertook this project entitled “ experimentation on utilization of human urine as fertilizers ” . <eos> the project was co-funded by unicef and sei . <eos> the broad objectives of the project are ; 1. to determine the efficacy of human urine as fertilizer and 2. to evolve methods for collection , transportation , storage and utilization of human urine . <eos> this project highlights the outcome of the second objective . <eos> although it is known that human urine has fertilizer value , it is not being utilized on a large scale . <eos> the obvious reason behind this is the psychological repugnance towards urine . <eos> this is mainly because of : i ) foul odour ii ) decomposition on storage & amp ; iii ) a universally accepted fact that anything given out of human body is untouchable . <eos> if these hurdles are overcome , there could be a revolutionary change in the utilization of human urine . <eos> if anyone wishes to replace the entire fertilizer input of a single crop with human urine , the quantity required is in thousands of liters per hectare . <eos> this obviously can not be fulfilled with the urine outputs of a single family . <eos> therefore efforts are necessary to harness the urine from public places like- schools , colleges , market places , offices , theatres etc . <eos> please see the link for details on this project on susana : < a href= '' http : //susana.org/lang-en/resource-material ? view=ccbktypeitem & amp ; type=2 & amp ; id=738 '' rel= '' nofollow '' > susana.org/lang-en/resource-material ? view=ccbktypeitem & amp ; am ... < /a > i would also like to make it clear that although you have categorized these photographs & amp ; my paper under ecosan-uddt , my project is little different . <eos> it is neither a part of ecosan activities nor have i used a uddt . <eos> my experiments are purely related to urine collection & amp ; utilization from public or school urinal . <eos> thus this project is purely based only on urine utilization . <eos> all photos in this set by shrikant navrekar nirmalgram @ rediffmail.com

the residents of llanrwst were eager to have their say on board the national assembly for wales bus on wednesday . <eos> many people came by after visiting the local library while others popped in on their way home from work . <eos> some local people said they feel there isn ’ t enough attention given to the people of north wales , so they were very glad to see the assembly bus in town . <eos> a local farmer said he was pleased that agriculture was a devolved matter but would be even happier if wales was to receive full law making powers in march . <eos> sixth form pupils from dyffryn conwy visited the bus and were very keen to learn more about voting next year as many will be doing so for the first time . <eos> the pupils ’ main concerns were unemployment and a lack of after school activities in their area . <eos> they particularly enjoyed watching a video about voting and took some useful information about voting home with them . <eos> < a href= '' http : //www.assemblywales.org '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.assemblywales.org < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.assemblywales.org/gethome/get-assembly-area/get_involved-bus_blog.htm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > bus blog < /a > _______________________________________ roedd trigolion llanrwst yn awyddus i ddweud eu barn ar fwrdd bws cynulliad cenedlaethol cymru ddydd mercher . <eos> daeth llawer draw ar ol picio i ’ r llyfrgell leol , tra daeth nifer heibio ar y ffordd o ’ u gwaith . <eos> sylw a wnaed gan lawer oedd nad yw gogledd cymru ’ n cael digon o sylw felly roeddent yn falch o groesawu bws y cynulliad i ’ w tref . <eos> roedd ffermwr lleol yn falch bod amaeth yn bwnc sydd wedi ’ i ddatganoli ond roedd o ’ r farn y byddai pethau ’ n well petai cymru ’ n cael pwerau deddfu llawn fis mawrth . <eos> roedd gan ddisgyblion chweched dosbarth ysgol dyffryn conwy ddiddordeb mewn dysgu mwy am bleidleisio gan y bydd llawer ohonynt yn pleidleisio am y tro cyntaf flwyddyn nesaf . <eos> y prif bethau oedd y disgyblion yn poeni amdanynt oedd diffyg cyfleoedd gwaith yn ogystal a phrinder gweithgareddau ar ol ysgol . <eos> roeddent oll yn falch o fynd a gwybodaeth adref gyda hwy yn ogystal a chyfle i weld clip fideo difyr am bleidleisio . <eos> < a href= '' http : //www.cynulliadcymru.org '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.cynulliadcymru.org < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.cynulliadcymru.org/gethome/get-assembly-area/get_involved-bus_blog.htm '' rel= '' nofollow '' > blog y bws < /a >

the day of ashura (  ( āshūrā ’ , ashura , ashoura , and other spellings ; turkish : aure günü is on the 10th day of muharram in the islamic calendar and marks the climax of the remembrance of muharram . <eos> it is commemorated by shia muslims as a day of mourning for the martyrdom of husayn ibn ali , the grandson of the islamic prophet muhammad at the battle of karbala on 10 muharram in the year 61 ah ( october 2 , 680 ce ) . <eos> according to sunni muslim tradition , muhammad fasted on this day and asked other people to fast . <eos> ; sunni muslims also remember the day claiming that moses fasted on that day to express gratitude to god for liberating the israelites from egypt . <eos> worldwide one of the major activity in this day is procession with tajia . <eos> there are several other activity occur under the umbrella of the procession .
oregon route 62 is an oregon state highway that runs between the city of medford , and u.s. route 97 between chiloquin and klamath falls . <eos> the highway approaches crater lake national park from the south , and is known as the crater lake highway . <eos> the rogue river in southwestern oregon in the united states flows about 215 miles ( 346 km ) in a generally westward direction from the cascade range to the pacific ocean . <eos> known for its salmon runs , whitewater rafting , and rugged scenery , it was one of the original eight rivers named in the wild and scenic rivers act of 1968. beginning near crater lake , which occupies the caldera left by the explosive volcanic eruption of mount mazama , the river flows through the geologically young high cascades and the older western cascades , another volcanic province . <eos> further west , the river passes through multiple exotic terranes of the more ancient klamath mountains . <eos> in the kalmiopsis wilderness section of the rogue basin are some of the world 's best examples of rocks that form the earth 's mantle . <eos> near the mouth of the river , the only dinosaur fragments ever discovered in oregon were found in the otter point formation , along the coast of curry county . <eos> people have lived along the rogue river and its tributaries for at least 8,500 years . <eos> european explorers made first contact with native americans ( indians ) toward the end of the 18th century and began beaver trapping and other activities in the region . <eos> clashes , sometimes deadly , occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and european-american miners and settlers . <eos> these struggles culminated with the rogue river wars of 1855C56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin . <eos> after the war , settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between grave creek and the mouth of the illinois river . <eos> they were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895 , when the post office department added mail-boat service along the lower rogue . <eos> as of 2010 , the rogue has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the united states .

& quot ; oregon 's premier arts and sciences festival & quot ; * < a href= '' http : //www.davincidays.org/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > http : //www.davincidays.org/ < /a > or rather , most of these pictures are of two races that are a small part of da vinci days : the & quot ; graand kinetic challenge & quot ; and the grand prix electrathon . <eos> i did n't take many photos of the festival area itself , which contained two stages and perhaps eighty other activities and demonstrations and exhibits . <eos> i love the idea behind the graand kinetic challege : a human-powered vehicle race where the vehicles must & quot ; ride over 10 miles of city streets , over a man-made sand dune , across 3000 feet of sun-dried , clay pasture , through 200 feet of deep , thick , sticky mud , and down 2 miles of the willamette river. & quot ; while the racers usually reconfigure their vehicles between stages , wheels , treads , pontoons , and what-not must be carried the whole way . <eos> ( as they appear in the set they 're backwards chronologically . ) <eos> * ok , can you name any < i > other < /i > oregon arts and science festivals ? <eos> me neither . <eos> or anything like it anywhere else , for that matter . <eos> which actually says something about how cool and unique da vinci days is .

talang-satang has been constituted as a national park under the jurisdiction of the sarawak state government , through section 19 of the national parks and nature reserves ordinance , 1998 ( cap . <eos> 27 ) . <eos> the details of the park are outlined in the notification dated 27 september 1999 ( cited as the talang-satang national park notification , 1999 ) which was published in the sarawak government gazette , 4 november 1999. talang-satang national park this is the first national park in sarawak to consist primarily of a marine area . <eos> it has been created for the primary purpose of marine turtle conservation . <eos> it consists of two sections : the satang section ( approximately 9,894 ha ) , and the talang-talang section ( approximately 9,520 ha ) . <eos> this park includes all four islands of pulau satang besar , pulau satang kecil , pulau talang-talang besar , and pulau talang-talang kecil , and the area of sea and sea bed for 4.8 km ( 3-statute miles ) from the highest point of each island . <eos> this will exclude all titled leasehold land on the island , except in cases for which settlement or agreements are negotiated with the titleholders . <eos> a permit from the forest department is necessary for entry to the park . <eos> the park is managed as a combination of nature tourism and conservation . <eos> marine education and recreation that does not have a negative impact on the marine environment will be encouraged . <eos> owing to the sensitive nature of the marine turtles ( at talang-talang ) and the small size of the islands , this section will remain off limits to visitors . <eos> satang besar island will be developed in co-operation with the landowners as a tourism destination . <eos> the rights and practices of the local landowners , villagers , and fishermen are recognized . <eos> the forest department works in close co-operation with them to ensure sustainable usage of the resources they are entitled to . <eos> indeed , the local population is very supportive of the formation of the national park because it creates employment , and helps to boost fish stocks for the area . <eos> the park consists of two areas : the core area . <eos> this is an area of 2km radius from the highest point of each island surrounding each of the 4 islands , as well as a 200m radius around pulau tukong ara and pulau tukong banun . <eos> these core areas are further sub-divided into : public appreciation zones . <eos> visitors will be allowed to enter with a permit and under constant supervision of park staff . <eos> it is a & quot ; look but do not touch zone & quot ; . <eos> conservation/research zones . <eos> these are strictly off limits to visitors . <eos> the complimentary areas . <eos> these are areas from 2km radius to 4.8km radius ( from the highest point of each island ) surrounding each of the 4 islands . <eos> these areas are not afforded absolute protection . <eos> certain fishing , boating , and diving activities will be permitted . <eos> the area of the sarawak turtle islands is also protected under a number of other government regulations . <eos> the turtles ( prevention of disturbance ) rules , 1962. currently the three islands of pulau talang-talang besar , pulau talang-talang kecil , and pulau satang besar are restricted areas under the above sarawak state government rules . <eos> the rules state that no vessel , other than a government vessel on official duty , shall enter within half a nautical mile of the low water mark of the above three islands , except with a permit granted by , or on behalf of , the turtle 's board . <eos> fisheries ( prohibited areas ) regulations 1994. currently , the maritime waters within two nautical miles of the outermost points of the islands ( as measured at the low water mark ) of : pulau talang-talang besar ; pulau talang-talang kecil ; and pulau satang besar ; are fisheries ( prohibited areas ) under section 61 of the fisheries act 1985. the department of fisheries , malaysia , controls this regulation . <eos> all forms of fishing and collecting are banned , however no permit is necessary to enter the area . <eos> now that the national park has been constituted , all of these agencies will be working in close co-operation to monitor and conserve the area .

in november 1 , 1818 , father joseph-norbert provencher built on this site a small log chapel which he dedicated to saint boniface , the english missionary monk and apostle , who spread the catholic faith among the germanic tribes in the 8th century . <eos> saint boniface , the first permanent mission west of the great lakes , became the heart of roman catholic missionary activity extending to the pacific and arctic coasts , as well as serving the growing population of the red river settlement . <eos> five cathedrals have stood on this beautiful location . <eos> in 1832 , bishop provencher erected a cathedral surmounted by twin spires , and in 1862 a stone cathedral was built under the direction of bishop taché . <eos> on august 15 , 1906 , archbishop langevin blessed the cornerstone of what became one of the most imposing churches in western canada . <eos> it was designed by the montreal architectural firm of marchand and haskell . <eos> this structure , the best example of french romanesque architecture in manitoba , was ravaged by fire on july 22 , 1968. the present cathedral , blessed by archbishop baudoux in 1972 , was designed by franco-manitoba architect étienne gaboury . <eos> it incorporates the sacristy , faade and walls of the former basilica . <eos> in the faade lie the tombs of the bishops of saint-boniface . <eos> louis riel , together with many of the west ’ s first catholic settlers , key figures and missionaries , is buried here in western canada ’ s oldest catholic cemetery .

the sacramento river is an important watercourse of northern and central california in the united states . <eos> the largest river in california , it rises on the eastern slopes of the klamath mountains , and after a journey south of over 400 miles ( 640 km ) , empties into suisun bay , an arm of the san francisco bay , and thence to the pacific ocean . <eos> the river drains an area of about 27,000 square miles ( 70,000 km ) in the northern half of the state , mostly within a region bounded by the coast ranges and sierra nevada known as the sacramento valley . <eos> its extensive watershed also reaches to the volcanic plateaus of northeastern california , and a tiny portion of southern oregon . <eos> the river has been an important transportation route since the time of the region 's first inhabitants , who appeared about 12,000 years ago . <eos> hundreds of distinct tribes sharing regional customs and traditions inhabited the sacramento valley , receiving little disturbance from the first foreign visitors to see the river . <eos> one of these early explorers , gabriel moraga , gave the river the spanish name , rio de los sacramentos , which was later shortened and anglicized into sacramento . <eos> the sacramento 's waters were once abundant in fish and other aquatic creatures , notably one of the southernmost runs of chinook salmon in north america . <eos> the natives of the sacramento valley drew upon the vast natural resources of the watershed , which had one of the densest native american populations of california . <eos> in the 19th century , the sacramento was changed forever by the discovery of gold in the sierra nevada , which led to an enormous population influx of american settlers . <eos> overland trails such as the california trail and siskiyou trail followed the sacramento , pit , feather , yuba and other rivers , guiding hundreds of thousands of people to the goldfields and the growing agricultural region of the sacramento valley floor . <eos> intensive agricultural practices , and mining activities in both the coast ranges and the sierra , contributed to chronic pollution in the sacramento and the destruction of many of its habitats . <eos> by the late part of the century , many cities had been established along the sacramento river , such as sacramento and redding . <eos> the tower bridge is a vertical lift bridge across the sacramento river , linking west sacramento in yolo county to the west , with the capital of california , sacramento , in sacramento county to the east . <eos> it was previously a part of u.s. route 40 until that highway was truncated east of salt lake city . <eos> the bridge is yet maintained by the california department of transportation as part of state route 275 , and connects west capitol avenue and tower bridge gateway in west sacramento with the capitol mall in sacramento . <eos> in 1982 , the tower bridge was added to the national register of historic places . <eos> it was to be 52 ft ( 16 m ) wide , with four lanes for cars , and one large center lane for trains . <eos> the towers are 160 ft ( 49 m ) . <eos> the bridge style represents a rare use of streamline moderne architectural styling in a lift bridge , making it an outstanding expression of the social and architectural climate of the period of construction . <eos> for years , the bridge was painted silver , but people complained about glare off the bridge . <eos> in june 1976 it was painted a yellow-ochre color , to be representative of the gold leafed cupola on the nearby state capitol . <eos> in 2001 , as the old paint job could hardly be distinguished , residents who lived within 35 mi ( 56 km ) of the capital voted on a new color scheme . <eos> their choices were burgundy , green , silver and gold ; or all gold . <eos> the winning color was all gold , and it was repainted in 2002. however , that did not lessen the bridge 's color controversy . <eos> some people complained that the new paint was not as gilded as advertised . <eos> others have suggested that copper would have been a far better color choice , especially in the context of nearby buildings .

despite being a vegeterian , i 've been obsessed with grilling for the last 10 years . <eos> it may be because lightng the grill is one of the few outdoor activities that is satisfying , and also possible with the limited outdoor space a person gets living in brooklyn . <eos> during our 2nd official brooklyn porch mafia bbq of the 2011 season , i wanted to experiment a bit wit shooting the flames in the grill . <eos> i had my nikon coolpix point and shoot with me , so i took these photos while playing around with all the available manual settings .
28 days of photos as an effort to find out whether my application of the art of photography can be forced , and if i can consistently find an interesting shot without staging an interesting event . <eos> i learned a lot from this experience . <eos> more , in fact , that i expected , and so i think it was time well-spent .

party @ kscr office on 4/27/2005
for ages an island by the entrance of the amsterdam harbor , named pampus , served as a defensive position and as a place where the ocean sailers anchored . <eos> in the late 19th century a fortress was built here , which , by the time it was finished was outdated already and therefore never used . <eos> for years the fortress was left alone to a slow process of decay . <eos> in the seventies i remember going there with friends to picknick and party , which was n't without danger because of the invisible , overgrown holes and cracks . <eos> about ten years ago a foundation of volunteers started taking care of this forgotten piece of heritage and now there is a regular ferry to the island in the summer with tours given in the fortress .

this is a sunrise view taken early on my way to work . <eos> i could tell fairly quickly that i was n't going to be able to get a clean shot without a tripod , so i decided to experiment with exaggerating the camera shake ( something i 've played with in the past ) . <eos> only minor adjustment to contrast and saturation to all of these . <eos> otherwise all the & quot ; effects & quot ; are in-camera . <eos> i particularly like the ones that look a little like mark rothko paintings .
these are some native american ritual mounds near little rock that are over 1,000 years old . <eos> they were the site of burials and other festivals . <eos> this site contains pictures of the mounds and surrounding nature .

several outings this month brought fun , collaboration , and new sights for me when i was with friends from flickr . <eos> many of the images are from the north and northeast of phoenix . <eos> 5 of us went out to cave creek and then on to the tonto national forest in the hiking area around the sears-kay ruin . <eos> it 's an ancient hohokam ruin of a fortified village with remainsof 40 rooms . <eos> the ruin itself is about a mile east of the desert images inclued in this set . <eos> other images were taken at desert foothills gardens in cave creek , and black canyon near the rock springs cafe .

bothe-napa valley state park stands as a reminder of the natural flora and fauna of the area before much of it was cleared to create vineyards . <eos> however , the soils and microclimates that have drawn grape growers for over 100 years remain . <eos> the park is also teeming with plants used by native americans in the region , who were likely the first people to use the valley 's bounties to make intoxicating concoctions .

fremont peak is the tallest point in the entire salinas/monterey region , overlooking the northern part of the salinas valley , and is covered with all the local television transmitter towers . <eos> the park is located around the peak , at around 3000 feet in elevation , and has about four miles of trails that form a loop , plus another trail that climbs a few hundred feet to the summit . <eos> nothing exceptional about the park , other than the panoramic views from santa cruz to monterey to the pinnacles . <eos> i chose a quiet weekday to check out the park , timing it so that i would finish at the summit right at sunset . <eos> as of 2008 , this is one of the parks that is slated for closure due to california budget cuts . <eos> pictures taken october 2 , 2007 .

the susan g. komen race for the cure , is not simply a fundraiser , it is an emotional celebration of courageous breast cancer survivors and a memorial for those who have lost their battle with the disease . <eos> it raises awareness of the importance of early detection and self advocacy and provides funding for national breast cancer research and local breast cancer treatment . <eos> since its origination in dallas in 1983 , the komen for the cure series has grown from one local race with 800 participants to a series of more than 100 races with more than one million people expected to participate . <eos> thousands joined us in march 2009 , and we look forward to that number increasing in march 2010 so that we can work together to live in a world without breast cancer .

war against the weak by justin strawhand ( 2009 , usa , 90 minutes , dvd ) war against the weak is a shocking investigation of american eugenics , arguably the most dangerous pseudoscience of all time , which became the largely unknown foundation for nazi genocide . <eos> even before hitler ’ s rise to power , a powerful mix of american corporate , scientific , academic and political elite was formulating a sinister racial and ethnic purification movement that attempted to breed a nordic master race through the elimination of those deemed physically or mentally unfit . <eos> under the nazis , eugenic principles were applied without restraint , and with the support of ivy league scientists funded by the carnegie institution , the rockefeller foundation and others . <eos> ingeniously condensed from the book by award-winning journalist edwin black , this film is a gripping account of bad science at its worst , and a warning bell in our impending genetic age . <eos> about justin strawhand justin ’ s first film , 8 bit : a documentary about art and videogames , which he produced and co-directed , premiered at the moma , was featured in wired magazine , and has toured the world to international acclaim . <eos> artforum put it on their “ top ten films of 2006. ” his sophomore effort , war against the weak , a visual history of the american eugenics movement and its direct influence on the holocaust , is currently touring the festival circuit . <eos> justin is beginning work on a new film , thinking horror , an exploration of the philosophy of extreme nihilism . <eos> peter demas is a film/television producer in nyc experimenting with photography full time . <eos> he really loves his camera .

i had insomnia last week and put it to good use . <eos> i also had sculpey , so this is essentially a free accessory for me . <eos> ( which is why i do n't mind that it 's ugly . ) <eos> pros 1. very easy to make 2. cheap if you already have sculpey on hand 3. fun 4. you feel like a frontier woman cons x. ugly x. you 'll probably need to paint it or decorate it to make yourself feel better x. there are lots of ways that can go wrong -- see my photos for one example tips if you do this , wrap the bottom of your kindle in plastic cling wrap before pressing it into the sculpey . <eos> try to design the back so that you do n't cover the speaker holes . <eos> you only need a slight lip on the front to hold the kindle in place . <eos> i probably could have made my lip even smaller , but as it is it just touches the space key but does n't obstruct it or press on it .

< a href= '' http : //500px.com/johanlb/stories/73083/one-day-at-roland-garros '' rel= '' nofollow '' > original story at 500px.com < /a > being at tennis french open roland garros is a great moment . <eos> as an individual sport , i think tennis brings naturally focus on personality and feelings of the players . <eos> in addition , at roland garros , tennis is played on clay court… slips and dust add some theatrical effects to the play and to pictures ! <eos> : ) i shoot more than 1000 shots… ( high-volume partly due to burst mode shoot ) ! <eos> my major issues was : - focus to make players fill the frame , i mainly used my 70-200mm set on max zooming position . <eos> i also used an aperture as wide as possible ( 2.8 ) to really have a shallow depth of field on the player and make distractions fade in the background . <eos> with these settings , depth of field was minimal and a tennis player is moving so fast ! <eos> i set my d3s on continuous focus mode and 3d focus mode . <eos> it really helps ! <eos> - tack sharp i usually prefer to freeze actions when shooting sports . <eos> and i think it 's really better here . <eos> two reasons : first , to freeze clay sent in the air by players footsteps and slips . <eos> second , the arm move in tennis is not really natural and photogenic . <eos> and when the player hit the ball , only his arm and chest are moving . <eos> so , i think it looks really better when frozen . <eos> i never really succeed to shot a nice tennis picture with slow shutter speed . <eos> so i had to really increase the shutter speed ( 1/2000th ) and iso ( 1600 ) . <eos> sometimes , to freeze the ball as well , i needed to shoot at 1/8000th ! <eos> wow : ) - be as close as possible not so easy in the big main & quot ; central court & quot ; : ( so i decide to shoot a lot secondary courts . <eos> specially junior players . <eos> you can shoot these matches from few meters away ! <eos> really better to catch dramatic actions . <eos> of course , i kept only the shots that i prefer and seems to be better . <eos> i think that my selection seems to demonstrate that shooting sport photography is truly to deal with the & quot ; decisive moment & quot ; . <eos> i shot a lot of other nice pictures this day… but the ones that really stands out are the ones taken at a peak of action or that show tough feelings of the players . <eos> few days ago , i heard this is why sport photographers and photojournalist have a lot of common skills . <eos> because it need to be & quot ; always ready & quot ; at the good time to catch the decisive moment , i think i have to acquire more automatism and be more fluent with using my dslr . <eos> if you do n't want to miss the shot , you ca n't browse the menus all the day ! <eos> so obviously , to improve my results , i have to practice , practice , and practice again… as usual : ) i hope that you will enjoy this serie : )

i ’ ve wanted to move to another part of the country for a while now , but this year i actually have the means to do it . <eos> as a result , these races are just a little bit more special to me . <eos> i may not be here next year to run down the list again . <eos> with that in mind , i find myself searching for more than just another race or another clock-time . <eos> i find myself calling co-workers to switch shifts for a race , and debating over whether to bring the camera to the course . <eos> on the one hand , i desperately want to document the memories , but on the other hand i ’ d like to leave the distraction behind and go for my best possible race time . <eos> i ’ m almost 35 now , so nostalgia tends to win over athletic ambition . <eos> here are a few photos from my latest race .
i knew that i would see some of my former co-workers at this race because coburg dairy is one of the sponsors . <eos> upon arrival i found robert garret at the coburg table , and one of his first questions was why i didn ’ t call him up for a free registration . <eos> he had four that no one even tried to claim . <eos> i was immediately reminded of how dense i can be when i get too busy . <eos> i completely forgot about the free registrations . <eos> i paid thirty bucks to be in this race , and i could have just picked up the phone . <eos> ouch . <eos> well , it was good to see a some of the old gang , anyway .

when the fields are fush with water there is one sight not to be missed , the kambala or the buffalo race that is unique to dakshina kannada . <eos> this is a unique sport of this region . <eos> the historically famous koti chennayya kambala race is held annually at moodabidri . <eos> at that time kambala was the event when farmers paid tribute to their gods for protecting their crops . <eos> there used to be lot of celebration and games as part of this festive atmosphere . <eos> some say kambala also marked the beginning of sowing operations for the second round of crops . <eos> currently its more politically motivated rather than any kind of a tribute .. kambala has been criticised by animal lovers as inhumane and barbaric due to use of whips on participating buffaloes . <eos> noted animal right activist , mrs. maneka gandhi has expressed serious concerns about the ill treatment of buffaloes during the race . <eos> there are huge sums of prize money for the winners along with all round betting for each of the race ..

sometime during the last century , surfers looked for something to do while waves were flat . <eos> attaching wheels to boxes and boards , the surfers―and their new pastime―took off . <eos> skateboarding has since evolved into a cultural phenomenon shaping art , music , architecture , and pop culture , transforming urban streets and cityscapes across the globe . <eos> at april ’ s exploratorium after dark event , we invited you to explore both the physics and cultural exploits of this urban art . <eos> visitors watched professional skateboarders demo the ramps inside the museum while we broke down the physics behind their tricks . <eos> drawn from the real , anti hero , spitfire , and thunder skateboarding teams , the dlx team includes dennis busenitz , tony trujillo , elissa steamer , jessie van roechoudt , brian anderson , frank gerwer , and peter ramondetta . <eos> guests explored the history and culture of skateboarding with slap magazine ’ s mark whiteley , screen printed their own t-shirt design with san franpsycho , watched skateboarding-related films and exhibits , and more . <eos> check out our cool exploratorium-designed , science-themed , limited-edition boards , which were created for the event and are available for a limited time . <eos> < a href= '' http : //store.exploratorium.edu/page.cfm/skateboards '' rel= '' nofollow '' > store.exploratorium.edu/page.cfm/skateboards < /a > learn more about skateboard science at < a href= '' http : //www.exploratorium.edu/skateboarding '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.exploratorium.edu/skateboarding < /a >

it had to happen eventually . <eos> things warmed up enough for me to try out a running event in vermont . <eos> oh , i ’ ve seen people running around since i got here , but i ’ m not frost-resistant yet , so i tend to think of them as crazy people . <eos> the mutt strutt is a fun little event which benefits the humane society . <eos> instead of making allowances for people who want to bring their dogs , this event encouraged it . <eos> in fact , it was the standard . <eos> there were dogs everywhere .
this was a pretty special race . <eos> you can get the details at the official site , which i designed for the event . <eos> the short explanation is that a local athlete had a stroke in december , and has no medical insurance through his job . <eos> he ’ s a really nice guy , and nobody likes to see people like that knocked down by the world , so the local running community put together a race to help him . <eos> more accurately , two of his closest friends put it together .

recently i cranked up the standards a bit . <eos> i participated in the save the light half-marathon , running 13.1 miles back and forth through the neighborhood around folly beach , south carolina . <eos> the goal of the event is to raise money for the local lighthouse . <eos> it was a big deal for me , since i had never run more than 12 miles in my entire life . <eos> even worse , working two jobs and moving into a new apartment kept me from training very much in the weeks before the race . <eos> ( as excuses go , those are pretty good . ) <eos> i knew i was in for an exhausting event , so i made some time and ran 8 miles about a week prior to the event . <eos> i felt just fine , so i gambled that 13.1 miles wouldn ’ t be too much harder than 12 .
another year , another bunch of people promising to exercise . <eos> right . <eos> whatever . <eos> some of us really do exercise , however . <eos> the familiar faces are starting to add up . <eos> for instance , i saw monica again . <eos> she seems to be at all the races these days , although her husband john is recovering from knee surgery and can ’ t participate for a while . <eos> ( must be driving him nuts ! )
i was going to do a simple 5k this weekend , but sara let me know that there was a 5-mile race on the same day . <eos> i wanted to test my post-winter fitness , so of course i went for the longer race . <eos> my goal was a modest 50 minutes , but i was in for a bit of a surprise . <eos> this race was really close to the jfk/umass stop on boston ’ s red line , and i live really close to the quincy center stop on the same line . <eos> this meant that getting to the site would be really , really convenient . <eos> unlike other races , i was able to take my time with coffee and breakfast before heading out . <eos> i was even able to dawdle a bit and post a quick morning video .
there won ’ t be many footraces after this point since winter is on the way , so i was excited to find out about an event right here in downtown burlington . <eos> the downtown 10k is less than a mile from my apartment , so how could i pass it up ?

this was my first race since moving back to south carolina from new england . <eos> sadly , the organizers overbooked it , resulting in an inexcusable jam in the parking lot , on the main road , and even on i-26 . <eos> the 20-mile trip took me over three hours , and it was almost all highway . <eos> everyone on-site agreed that the most difficult obstacle was just getting to the site . <eos> but at least the race was good . <eos> everyone was late , so they let us go whenever we could assemble our teams . <eos> as long as the organizers wake up and get their acts together , i 'd be glad to do this race again next year .

interestingly enough , although the chicago marathon passes literally just a few steps from my front door , this is the first time in the four years it has run since i moved here that i have actually watched any of it . <eos> quite impressive to see so many people who dedicated months preparing for this event . <eos> unfortunately , this marathon will always be remembered as the one with the crazy unseasonal heat wave that resulted in the race being halted early as well as causing one fatality and hundreds of hospitalizations .

monica and joe took this shirt to ireland for madison drezek 's class project . <eos> it visited : the ha'penny bridge ( known later for a time as the penny ha'penny bridge ) is a pedestrian bridge built in 1816 over the river liffey in dublin , ireland . <eos> originally called the wellington bridge ( after the duke of wellington ) , the name of the bridge changed to liffey bridge , and somewhat surprisingly , the name remains as so to this day . <eos> however , due to its distinct shape as well as the original toll of one halfpenny , ( later , one penny , two farthings ) the more popular title of ha'penny bridge stuck in the minds of the natives . <eos> the toll itself was dropped in 1919 ; before this , turnstiles lay on either side of it . <eos> before the ha'penny bridge had been built there were seven ferries that operated from one side of the liffey to the other under the watchful eye of william walsh . <eos> the ferries had been said to be in a bad condition and he was told that he had to either fix the ferries or build a bridge . <eos> walsh chose the latter option and was granted the right to extract a ha'penny toll from anyone crossing it for 100 years . <eos> the bridge was originally built from cast iron , which has a great tendency to decay with age . <eos> this was especially evident in the side rails , which had begun to rust badly . <eos> from 2001 to 2003 the bridge was closed for repair and renovations , and was reopened sporting a new white colour instead of black , and a resupported structure containing as many of the old components of the bridge as possible . <eos> the repair work was carried out by harland and wolff , makers of the rms titanic . <eos> and : millennium child monument next to st. patrick 's cathedral .

this is the second parade of the day . <eos> it included the same set of drummers , but everyone else was different .

the first of 2 carnivale parades today . <eos> according to my source , the parades were delayed due to the school holidays . <eos> this parade consisted of students from the local preschools and elementary schools . <eos> the preschools were very organized , and each class dressed as the same thing : mexicans , indians , chinese , owls , etc . <eos> the elementary schools , however , apparently told the kids to just wear whatever costumes they wanted . <eos> one school included an anti-smoking message , but it was the only one that did so .
pics of our first st. patrick 's day in dublin . <eos> the place was heaving with people , mostly families . <eos> the parade was brilliant and obviously a lot work went into it by all the groups that participated .

born : february 20 , 1988 rihanna established her dance-pop credentials in summer 2005 with her debut smash hit , & quot ; pon de replay , & quot ; and continued to demonstrate hit potential in subsequent years ( e.g. , & quot ; s.o.s. & quot ; in 2006 ; & quot ; umbrella & quot ; in 2007 ; & quot ; disturbia & quot ; in 2008 ) . <eos> however , it was the singer 's third album , good girl gone bad , that made her a full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts . <eos> born robyn rihanna fenty on february 20 , 1988 , in saint michael , barbados , she exhibited a certain star quality as a young child , often winning beauty and talent contests . <eos> because she lived on the fairly remote island of barbados in the west indies , however , she never foresaw the sort of stardom that would later befall her . <eos> that stardom came courtesy of a fateful meeting with evan rogers . <eos> the new yorker was vacationing in barbados with his wife , a native of the island , when he was introduced to rihanna . <eos> rogers had spent years producing pop hits for such superstars as * nsync , christina aguilera , jessica simpson , kelly clarkson , laura pausini , and rod stewart , and he offered the talented rihanna a chance to record . <eos> along with rogers ' production partner , carl sturken ( the other half of syndicated rhythm productions ) , rihanna recorded several demos that sparked the interest of the carter administration -- that is , the newly appointed def jam president shawn & quot ; jay-z & quot ; carter . <eos> this led to an audition , and rihanna both received and accepted an on-the-spot offer to sign with def jam . <eos> come summer 2005 , def jam rolled out & quot ; pon de replay , & quot ; the lively leadoff single from music of the sun . <eos> produced almost entirely by rogers and sturken , the song synthesized caribbean rhythms with urban-pop songwriting . <eos> & quot ; pon de replay & quot ; caught fire almost immediately , climbing all the way to number two on the billboard hot 100 and contesting the half-summer reign of mariah carey 's & quot ; we belong together & quot ; atop the chart . <eos> the debut album spawned one other hit , & quot ; if it 's lovin ' that you want , & quot ; which also broke the top 40. rihanna 's follow-up effort , a girl like me , saw even greater success and spawned three sizable singles : a chart-topper ( & quot ; s.o.s. & quot ; ) and two top ten hits ( & quot ; unfaithful , & quot ; & quot ; break it off & quot ; ) . <eos> rihanna 's third album , 2007 's good girl gone bad , continued her success while signaling a change of direction . <eos> whereas her past two albums had been imbalanced -- often weighed down by faceless balladry and canned caribbean-isms -- good girl gone bad was a first-rate dance-pop album , stacked with several chart-topping singles and boasting collaborations with jay-z , ne-yo , timbaland , and stargate . <eos> the lead single , & quot ; umbrella , & quot ; shot to number one , as did & quot ; take a bow & quot ; and & quot ; disturbia. & quot ; its success turned rihanna into one of the planet 's biggest pop stars . <eos> rated r was released in 2009 during the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest chris brown , who pleaded guilty to felony assault . <eos> the album 's lead single , & quot ; russian roulette & quot ; -- written with ne-yo -- was one of the year 's most controversial singles , and it set the tone for the singer 's new , dark direction . <eos> rated r peaked within the top five of the billboard 200 , while another one of its singles , & quot ; rude boy , & quot ; topped the hot 100. rated r : remixed was released in the spring of 2010 and featured ten tracks from the album revamped for the dancefloor by chew fu . <eos> loud , rihanna 's fifth studio album , followed in november and was led by the stargate-produced & quot ; only girl ( in the world ) . & quot ; jason birchmeier , rovi

lower antelope canyon is one of the most famous slot canyons in the world . <eos> it is located a few miles from page , arizona ; visiting it is an otherworldly experience . <eos> it is a photographers dream with great colors and natural formation . <eos> i arranged the photos in this set to go from entering the slot canyon to the turnaround point a few hundred yards away . <eos> i took most of the photos looking up at a sharp angle . <eos> if you have a chance to visit either the lower or upper antelope canyon , do it - but it is getting expensive - in april 2010 it was a total of $ 26/person . <eos> you have to go in with a guided tour but if you ask , they will give you a photo pass that allows you to wander away from the group once inside . <eos> a tripod is a must inside the canyon , and watch out for fine dust blowing everywhere . <eos> i took these photos in april 2010 as part of my spring 2010 this sure beats working any day tour .

i visited nuremburg in october 2009 on what had to be the worst day of the year . <eos> it was a few hours of total , solid rain - somewhere between a downpour , deluge of biblical proportions , or a flood . <eos> i was completely soaked and was afraid to take my camera out , so consequently there are very few photos . <eos> that is a shame since nuremburg is a very attractive city - better luck next time !

north dakota military leaders to gather for workshop , conference fargo , n.d. ― the north dakota national guard will host a professional development workshop for leaders at all levels in the state ’ s army and air guard on march 11-14. it will coincide with the annual combined associations conference , which brings together members of the officers and enlisted associations ― professional organizations national guard members may choose to join . <eos> the theme for this year ’ s conference is “ adding value to our communities , state and nation. ” senior military leaders and deployed north dakota national guard commanders will offer insights reflective on that theme to the nearly 500 registrants . <eos> three top military leaders will kick off the main portion of the conference friday morning ; they include lt. gen. harry m. wyatt iii , director of the air national guard ; lt. gen. robert r. allardice , 18th air force commander at scott air force base , ill. ; and maj. gen. raymond w. carpenter , acting director of the army national guard . <eos> friday afternoon brings north dakota-specific updates with deployed commanders briefing from their mission locations in kosovo , iraq and afghanistan . <eos> maj. gen. david sprynczynatyk , north dakota national guard adjutant general , will give his state of the north dakota national guard address , as well . <eos> the conference ’ s keynote speaker , retired sgt . <eos> 1st class dana bowman will speak on “ managing change : the only constant ” and , as the closing address , on “ conquering adversity. ” bowman served in the army as a special forces soldier and member of the army ’ s elite golden knights parachute team . <eos> bowman lost his legs during a 1994 training accident with the knights , and nine months later became the first double amputee to re-enlist in the army . <eos> portions of the conference will be targeted toward military families , including a direct address from sprynczynatyk and sessions titled , “ volunteers : where the rubber meets the road , ” “ preparing for disasters , deployments and difficulties ” and “ kids serve , too. ” a working lunch on saturday will address “ soldiers and airmen : caring for our own. ” during a banquet saturday evening , the north dakota army national guard will name the enlisted soldier of the year and noncommissioned officer of the year out of a group of finalists who have been preparing and testing for the past year . <eos> additionally , north dakota ’ s national guard association will name the company-grade officer of the year and field-grade officer of the year for the army and air guard . <eos> airmen of the year , who were named during a march 6 ceremony , will be recognized , as well . <eos> an additional award , the national guard association of the united states ’ charles dick medal of merit , will be presented to congressman earl pomeroy on sunday . <eos> the award recognizes contributions to the national guard by elected officials .

castle and short walk around the grounds
this historic site is one of the most interesting , and certainly one of the most photogenic places we 've ever visited . <eos> sometimes known as & quot ; the white dove of the desert & quot ; , it has been undergoing a very expensive and painstaking restoration for the past several years . <eos> here are quotes from the wikipedia article and a few links : & quot ; outside , san xavier has a white , moorish-inspired design , elegant and simple , with an ornately decorated entrance . <eos> no records of the architect , builders , craftsmen and artisans responsible for creating and decorating it are known . <eos> most of the labor was provided by the local indians , and many believe they provided most or all of the artisans as well . <eos> visitors entering the massive , carved mesquite-wood doors of san xavier are often struck by the coolness of the interior , and the dazzling colors of the paintings , carvings , frescoes and statues . <eos> the interior is richly decorated with ornaments showing a mixture of new spain and native american artistic motifs . <eos> & quot ; the floor plan of the church resembles the classic latin cross . <eos> the main aisle is separated from the sanctuary by the transept or cross aisle , with chapels at either end . <eos> the dome above the transept is 52 feet ( 16 m ) high supported by arches and squinches . <eos> at least three different artists painted the artwork inside the church . <eos> it is considered by many to be the finest example of spanish mission architecture in the united states. & quot ; < a href= '' http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mission_san_xavier_del_bac '' rel= '' nofollow '' > en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mission_san_xavier_del_bac < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.sanxaviermission.org/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.sanxaviermission.org/ < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.arizona-vacation-planner.com/san-xavier-mission.html '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.arizona-vacation-planner.com/san-xavier-mission.html < /a >

the pinakothek der moderne is the modern art museum in munich - i visited it on a rainy sunday in october 2009 ( only one euro on sundays ) . <eos> modern art museums always leave me wondering what i 'm looking at - such as if something is an exhibit , unfinished construction , or the work of a six year old . <eos> what i really like is to walk by while people are discussing what the artist was trying to convey - my guess is the artist is sunning on some tropical island with all the cash he/she was paid for the painting . <eos> with that said , this is still a pretty interesting museum - especially on a rainy day !

< a href= '' http : //www.usaraf.army.mil '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.usaraf.army.mil < /a > army reserve medics help u.s. army africa make a difference by rick scavetta , u.s. army africa vicenza , italy C army reserve medical support for upcoming u.s. army africa missions was the main topic during maj. gen. robert kasulke ’ s recent visit to caserma ederle . <eos> kasulke , commander of the u.s. army reserve medical command , wrapped up a two-day visit to u.s. army africa headquarters on mar . <eos> 17. during his stay , kasulke met with senior u.s. army africa staff and toured garrison medical facilities C to include the final stages of construction of vicenza military community ’ s new health clinic . <eos> “ the point of my visit is to work u.s. army africa to get army reserve medical personnel more involved in missions in africa , ” kasulke said . <eos> “ we have a huge pool of fully-trained and certified medical folks that we can draw from . <eos> and there are great opportunities for medical missions on the african continent. ” without assigned forces , u.s. army africa relies on support from other army units to assign soldiers for missions in africa , said col. alfonso alarcon , u.s. army africa ’ s senior medical officer . <eos> u.s. army africa needs to have a strong relationship with army reserve medical leaders to access reserve medical staff for exercises , outreach clinics and familiarization events in africa , alarcon said . <eos> “ there are tremendous ways for army reserve medical soldiers to make a difference and advance global security objectives through real-world training with our land forces partners in africa , ” alarcon said . <eos> medical officers play a large role in u.s. army africa engagements , to include the 2009 exercise medflag in swaziland . <eos> another medflag exercise is being planned for central africa this summer . <eos> in october 2009 , when a pregnant ugandan woman arrived at a u.s. army clinic during exercise natural fire 10 , a u.s. army reserve officer C who happened to be a labor and delivery nurse in her civilian job in abilene , texas C helped the woman deliver her newborn son . <eos> her efforts are one example of what army reserve medical staff can bring to military missions in africa , kasulke said . <eos> for army reserve medics , taking care of patients overseas , in places that often lack quality healthcare , is a “ soul-satisfying mission , ” kasulke said . <eos> during the recent visit , command sgt . <eos> maj. roger schulz , the army reserve ’ s senior medical noncommissioned officer , accompanied kasulke , a vascular surgeon from upstate new york who took command of the florida-based army reserve medical command in october 2009. more than 28,000 army reserve soldiers serve in medical roles . <eos> for several years , reserve medics conducted training and exercises in place like central america C experience that can be applied to u.s. army africa ’ s future missions , kasulke said . <eos> some african medical officers are seeking help to develop better medical care , such as surgery centers and clinics . <eos> the army reserve has experts in establishing medical systems C from managers to professors C who could help organize assistance with that process , kasulke said . <eos> “ the end point would be to help african partners develop systems that enable us to step back and they can carry on , ” kasulke said . <eos> his command also has planners with experience organizing medical event that could help u.s. army africa staff , as the command continues to conduct military familiarization events on medical topics , where u.s. army officers and ncos discuss their profession with their counterparts . <eos> maj. terry clark , a u.s. army reserve officer , is on active-duty orders serving as a medical planner and physician assistant in the command ’ s surgeon office . <eos> clark has recently led medical mentoring missions in botswana , malawi and morocco . <eos> “ working with african military medical officers offers a great opportunity for both u.s. army africa and the land forces of our african partner nations to build relationships that can lead to future events in the medical field , ” clark said . <eos> “ we share information on how u.s. soldiers conduct healthcare and also learn a lot about how medicine is practiced in africa. ” photos by sgt . <eos> 1st class kyle davis , u.s. army africa to learn more about u.s. army africa visit our official website at < a href= '' http : //www.usaraf.army.mil '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.usaraf.army.mil < /a > official twitter feed : < a href= '' http : //www.twitter.com/usarmyafrica '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.twitter.com/usarmyafrica < /a > official youtube video channel : < a href= '' http : //www.youtube.com/usarmyafrica '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.youtube.com/usarmyafrica < /a >

i first visited dresden in late 1993 - it still felt very like a communist run and bombed out east germany city . <eos> when i returned on this trip in october 2009 i noticed a world of difference as soon as i left the train station . <eos> everything is much more alive and vibrant . <eos> this is a great walking city and well worth visiting if you are in the area . <eos> this was my last full day in germany and i wanted to see dresden so i took the ice from frankfurt and it still took 5 hours each way - this made for a long day but it was definitely worth it . <eos> next time i 'll spend a day or two here - great city !

the strip is most people 's idea of las vegas . <eos> expensive , excessive , fun , and overwhelming . <eos> downtown is the older ( and cheaper ) vegas , so of course that 's where my friends and i stayed . <eos> one afternoon i took a walk to reacquaint myself with the sun .

brent 's & amp ; lori 's wedding was in july in racine and kenosha .
our fearless wedding planner and fantastic friend orchestrated getting our precious kegs of manny 's pale ale into the sheraton . <eos> since they brought up keg cups no-questions-asked , we doubt much subterfuge was involved . <eos> all our dearest friends ( and some of our parents ) were in the room , so it was the perfect end to the night . <eos> well , maybe not the keg stand by the elevator

on st patrick 's day 2007 , my sister annette married scott . <eos> in the days before we were waiting for bridezilla to rear iher head , but thankfully she never did , though there were some nerves and stress . <eos> but the day turned out great . <eos> no major ( or minor ) incidences , no tantrums , all went smooth . <eos> nettskie looked beautiful , scott was suitably nervous and we all could n't wait for the bar to open to crack a drink . <eos> weather was beautiful but hot ! <eos> it was so hot that by the end of the night we 'd drank so much ( alcohol and soft drink ) that we doubled the expected bar tab . <eos> everyone had a great night , it was a big weekend and i dunno about everyone else but it took me a week to recover .
these are the pictures i took of the party . <eos> much congrats to the new couple !
a collection of dark , blurred , random shots , almost all from the same spot propping up the bar for 6 hours . <eos> the bride and groom are almost nowhere to be seen in this lot .
the main event and the putative reason for this roadtrip in the first place . <eos> my grandfather married an old friend of his , lois s smith ( the & quot ; s & quot ; is for smith ― it 's kind of a long story ) . <eos> it was a montana wedding , which is to say low-key and charming . <eos> it was also a real challenge to shoot .
there was a flame-juggling , unicycling comedian performing to a large crowd while a wedding party was taking pictures .
