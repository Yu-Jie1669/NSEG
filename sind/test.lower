following on from a backpacker 's club meet held last november when six of us made the ascent of great gable to attend the annual fell & amp ; rock climbing club ceremony of remembrance , i decided to repeat the exercise and accordingly notified the chapel house farm campsite and the riverside bar at the scafell hotel in rosthwaite to be on standby . <eos> alas the anticipated rush failed to materialise as four of the seven potential attendees failed to show for their legitimate and various reasons . <eos> however it is well kent that apart from toga-parties there is not necessarily a strong correlation between the numbers taking part and the pleasure that might reasonably be anticipated from joining-in . <eos> and so it was it was with our small , perfectly formed yet well-matched trio . <eos> saturday saw us on the fells above honister and on sunday we joined the throng and made our way to great gable . <eos> and good it was too .
happy father 's day at la via .

i 'm a beer guy . <eos> i do n't typically like whiskey . <eos> but when in rome ... this tour was very educational and fun . <eos> at the end , when we were permitted to sample two types of their whiskey products , i genuinely enjoyed the buffalo trace and their single-barrel version ( will have to look up the name and place here . ) <eos> we were also informed that in kentucky , dessert do n't count , so we were given a sample of their creme liquor , which was also delicious . <eos> when added to their root beer , i found a new favorite treat .

my order arrived today , and in the fine tradition of tom bihn customers , i decided to take some photos . <eos> in total , i spent - my frugal friends might want to look away - $ 228 ( including ups shipping ) on these bags . <eos> i 've never forked over that much money for stuff-haulers before , ever . <eos> but i 'm happy to report ( though admittedly it 's only been a few hours ) that i do n't regret a cent thus far !
the parkwood cemetery consisting of one acre located in 29 township , 19 range three west is situated in jefferson county , alabama . <eos> as of september 11 , 2003 it was listed on the alabama historical cemetery register . <eos> this cemetery was originally called jacob cemetery for george jacobs who on august 6 , 1873 , deeded a portion of his land to coward , harkness , patton and crotwell as trustees for a place of worship for the membership of the methodist episcopal church . <eos> the church was also used as a school house for many years . <eos> on the 20th day of april 1896 , preston d. brooks and his wife , martha jane brooks deeded this property to george cowart , a.a. ross , elis ross and their successors with the right to sell and convey the property . <eos> on july 5 , 1939 a record of cemeteries was made by research worker andy perolio of the jefferson county board of health , bureau of records and vital statistics , showing the name of owner to be a baptist association , the oldest cemetery marker being january 1 , 1876 , last marker as of march 26 , 1935. the local church was permanently closed and the burial register and instructions left with j.w . <eos> logle , rt 2 , box 352 , bessemer , alabama on august 11 , 1941. the coward family were early settlers who lived in this area , worked at mills and taught school on the site . <eos> rev . <eos> c.w . <eos> mills preached in the early church on this property . <eos> some of the people who were buried in the cemetery were workers in the laying of the south and north railroad . <eos> there is a good reference to the parkwood area in history of hoover , alabama and it 's people . <eos> one of the men of the large coward family ran the sandstone quarry during the civil war , from which the stone was cut for the construction of the ross culvert over ross creek . <eos> later the ownership of the quarry passed to peter curren and then to george urie . <eos> the curren family are of indian descent on their maternal side and many family members are buried here . <eos> robert curren acquired ownership of this cemetery in 1978 and assumes responsibility to maintain it . <eos> there are many plants , scrubs and trees native to this area still remaining on the grounds .

photos by u.s. air force master sgt . <eos> dawn m. price a team of soldiers from the u.s. army 's 402nd civil affairs battalion teamed up with townspeople in dikhil , djibouti , this month to renovate the region 's only high school . <eos> the goal of the two-month project , which began april 16 , is to renovate six classrooms and an office with a new ceiling , windows , doors , lighting fixtures , blackboards and a fresh coat of paint . <eos> the problems with the school are mainly due to termites and pigeon waste , which have accumulated and weighed down the ceilings , making it unsafe for the students , said u.s. army capt . <eos> courtney sanders , chief of civil affairs team 402 . <eos> ¡° what ¡¯ s going on is , the pigeons have roosted in the ceilings of the classrooms , ¡± sanders said . <eos> ¡° and the termites of course eat the wood , ¡± she said . <eos> water damage and mold are also significant problems with the school . <eos> ¡± in addition to the threat of collapsing the school 's ceiling , the 700 or so students are at risk of becoming infected with histoplasmosis , a fungal infection caused by breathing airborne mold particles commonly found in areas with high concentrations of bird droppings , she said . <eos> the nearly $ 10,000 project is being completed with the help of townspeople , especially in terms of supplying manual labor , the organization of which has been coordinated by the dikhil prefect , mohammad cheiko hassan . <eos> ¡° the majority of the work is actually done by the prefect ¡¯ s laborers , as well as the parent teacher association here in dikhil , ¡± sanders said . <eos> ¡° from day one they ¡¯ ve beat us to the work site . <eos> they ¡¯ re very excited about this project . <eos> ¡° this is something that they ¡¯ ve been wanting on for a long time . <eos> they ¡¯ re motivated , they ¡¯ re happy and they welcome us with open arms , ¡± she said . <eos> their efforts have been such that the project could finish weeks ahead of schedule , sanders said , and reflect the high value the people ascribe to a functioning school . <eos> education is very important in dikhil , said houssein awaleh , dikhil prefect construction department manager . <eos> ¡° this is for the kids , for their education , and that ¡¯ s crucial , and because of that we ¡¯ re very thankful to everyone who is helping us , ¡± houssein said . <eos> for their part , the six-person army team facilitated the project , procured the necessary materials and began ripping out the parts of the school needing replacement . <eos> the deconstruction phase had to be completed by april 23 so as to not interfere with the student class schedules , sanders said . <eos> in addition , the 402nd team plans to provide the school with a fresh coat of paint and renovate six classrooms and an office . <eos> team member sgt . <eos> dennis figueroa said he ¡¯ s looking forward to seeing the end result of the renovation . <eos> ¡° i want to see them have something new , something that they worked hard for , ¡± figueroa said . <eos> ¡° they ¡¯ ve been working hard on this , renovating the school . <eos> this is something they can have pride in. ¡± once the project is complete , the building will be maintained by the laborers who carried out the renovations . <eos> dikhil has the only high school in its region , and students from all over the area travel to attend classes there . <eos> < b > to learn more about u.s. army africa visit our official website at < a href= '' http : //www.usaraf.army.mil '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.usaraf.army.mil < /a > official twitter feed : < a href= '' http : //www.twitter.com/usarmyafrica '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.twitter.com/usarmyafrica < /a > official vimeo video channel : < a href= '' http : //www.vimeo.com/usarmyafrica '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.vimeo.com/usarmyafrica < /a > < /b >

my < a href= '' http : //shop.vermontteddybear.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > vermont teddy bear < /a > with chocolate in hand was delivered to me one day late . <eos> the card said , & quot ; happy valentine 's day , love jim. & quot ; it arrived at school on valentine 's day , but it was n't logged and processed until the day after . <eos> valentine 's day was quite full with students giving out valentines to each other and enjoying refreshments at the party . <eos> i was quite busy . <eos> it 's a good thing the bear was late because it was a big hit in my classroom too . <eos> the girls all wanted a chance to hold judy . <eos> then the boys began finding other animals in the room to hold . <eos> it was a busy afternoon in the midst of doing reading , math , and english .

several weeks ago i went to see the doctor concerning a stomachache . <eos> i really do n't think there is anything wrong with me , but the doctor wanted me to have a colonoscopy . <eos> my appointment at out patient was for 7 am . <eos> we were up in the observation room by 7:30 and hooked up with wires . <eos> jim was with me and took pictures throughout and sent them to flickr . <eos> they took me to the little room for the procedure at 9:00 am . <eos> i was back in the observation room at 10 am . <eos> my stomach hurt because of the air that was pumped into my colon . <eos> the findings for my procedure was : diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon . <eos> i was discharged to go home . <eos> i am to repeat the colonoscopy in 5 years for surveillance . <eos> after a sip of some apple juice , they wheeled me down to our truck . <eos> jim and i stopped by the valdosta country club for lunch . <eos> i ate black bean soup , roll/butter , fried chicken , yellow squash , green beans , and coconut cream pie . <eos> i washed it down with diet coke . <eos> i did n't eat huge portions . <eos> i am fine except for a little grogginess from the demerol . <eos> after a brief stop at our house , jim drove me over to the town where i work because we had to pick up something in an office . <eos> afterwards he was able to see my new classroom for the first time and drop off some stuff i 'd bought for open house . <eos> then we drove to his office to pick up something he needed . <eos> on the way home we stopped at chili 's and shared some fajitas . <eos> even though it was a rough day yesterday , today turned out to be a nice little vacation day with jim . <eos> when i got home , my regular doctor had left a message that the results of my mammogram taken last week looked good too . <eos> i 'm finally taking care of some necessary tests to learn early if there is a problem . <eos> : - ) thanks for all your comments . <eos> here are photos of < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/judybaxter/sets/479045/ '' > jim 's colonoscopy < /a > .

i learned some things from last year , and lr2 helped a lot ( mainly because i could make a preset and apply it everywhere to get the brightness curve and wb i wanted ) . <eos> next time i 'll try to remember to pay attention to the fact that the nikon leaves autoiso on in manual mode ( which did n't really matter that much since the dark areas are black ) but otherwise i 'm pretty happy .

the petersen house is the & quot ; house where lincoln died. & quot ; it 's located across the street from ford 's theatre in washington , d.c. the house was built in 1849 by william a. petersen , a german tailor . <eos> the petersens and their descendants continued to live in the house until 1893. an avid ( some say & quot ; obsessive & quot ; ) lincolniana collector , osborn oldroyd , rented the house and put his vast collection of lincoln artifacts on display there . <eos> in 1896 , oldroyd persuaded congress to buy the house , and allow him to live in it rent-free so long as he kept his lincoln museum open . <eos> oldroyd died in 1926 , and congress purchased his collection . <eos> the collection was moved to the basement of ford 's theatre in 1932 , and the petersen house restored as & quot ; the house where lincoln died & quot ; . <eos> the national park service took over both ford 's theatre and the petersen house in 1933. in 2007 , the ford 's theatre society purchased the townhouse next to the petersen house and began building the ford ¡¯ s theatre center for education and leadership . <eos> it is now a museum documenting the aftermath of the lincoln assassination , and the impact lincoln has had on the united states . <eos> the upper four floors document the aftermath of lincoln ¡¯ s assassination , the legacy of lincoln , lincoln ¡¯ s leadership qualities , and a lobby and bookstore . <eos> the two sub-floors contain an education and conference center . <eos> between the second and first floors is a winding staircase and 34-foot tower of books about abraham lincoln . <eos> the center opened in february 2012 .

if you walk through the locally famous god 's acre moravian cemetery in old salem ( winston-salem , nc ) , down the hill and across the younger and more traditional downtown city cemetery ( where many reynolds and hanes are buried ) to its back corner , you 'll find what seems to be moravian-style gravestones for slaves . <eos> there is no historical marker for this little cemetery annex , physically separated from god 's acre . <eos> the slave graveyard at salem 's st. philips church was closed in 1859. so we guess after that the slaves , ex-slaves , and & quot ; strangers & quot ; ( white visitors who were n't moravian ) were buried out here .

a four-times-a-year-on-the-solstice flickr project that records an ordinary day . <eos> my day started early , but not as early as some . <eos> when i went out to get the newspaper , around 6 am , plenty of folks were already jogging . <eos> a friend came over to help me weed , a task i dislike , and then we went out to lunch . <eos> later , i drove around and did chores . <eos> on my way home , i stopped at a local farmstand . <eos> it 's small but lovely , and it features fresh produce grown right there . <eos> by the end of the day , i was tuckered out . <eos> i went to bed right after the weather forecast .

family portraits outside the church before grandpa lindberg 's funeral .
my cousin 's husband died suddenly of a probable myocardial infarction at the age of 50. he was a true rodeo cowboy , rancher and oil rig fella , respected and loved by so many . <eos> most of all , he was a dedicated husband and father . <eos> in the funeral procession , his three sons on horseback followed the horse and buggy carrying their father 's casket . <eos> beside their three horses walked the empty-saddled horse belonging to our beloved fallen cowboy , with his favorite boots , empty and riding backwards in the stirrups , in his honor . <eos> love and joy abounded , despite the terribly sad day .

read & amp ; relax area , first floor may 5-november 7 , 2011 the first issue of the flat hat was printed on october 3 , 1911. its name was derived from a secret society , dating back to 1750 , nicknamed the ¡° flat hat club. ¡± this club claimed thomas jefferson as a member and predates phi beta kappa , the nation 's oldest academic honor society . <eos> the flat hat has been published weekly ( except for the fall semester of 1918 ) up until 2007 when it began publishing twice weekly . <eos> with such a legacy , the flat hat is often considered the ¡° official ¡± student newspaper for the college of william & amp ; mary . <eos> in this exhibit , we celebrate 100 years of the flat hat . <eos> we hoped to address two questions : ¡° what voice did the flat hat contribute to the william & amp ; mary community ? ¡± and ¡° how has the voice changed ( or not ) over the years ? ¡± the exhibit begins with how the flat hat covered major news events by looking at the college during times of ¡° war and peace. ¡± although student reactions to war vary over time , the display about social events shows that when looking at opinions about fraternity housing to homecoming queens ¡° some things never change. ¡± ¡° sticking with traditions ¡± reveals the lost traditions of freshmen wearing beanies and seniors carrying ¡° swagger sticks ¡± as well as long-standing traditions such as the yule log and seniors ringing the wren bell . <eos> many of these traditions and events were captured in images proving that ¡° a picture is worth a hundred years. ¡± the flat hat moved from primarily printed words to including more photographs , cartoons , and advertisements . <eos> finally , ¡° time to get taboo : a retrospective of race and sex in the flat hat , ¡± confirms that although the flat hat has the longest history among campus publications , it has represented diverse student voices throughout the century . <eos> this exhibit was curated by students in prof. sharon zuber ¡¯ s ¡° constructing the news ¡± introduction to literary and cultural studies class ( lcst 201 ) and the special collections research center staff . <eos> student curators : joseph acosta , arthi aravind , laura brond , alexcia cleveland , sophia cohen , claire crawford , ainsley davis , elizabeth debusk , john gunnison , brett hayes , elizabeth hexter , abbey howarth , suzannah howell , angela mcintosh , rachel pulley , jessica roffenbender , kayla trantham , victoria willems , aria dakota willis , and rosemary willis . <eos> exhibit design and installation : chandi singer , burger archives assistant ; ben bromley , public services archives specialist ; priscilla wood , scrc volunteer .

the times square armed forces recruiting station 's prime location makes it one of the busiest recruiting stations in the world . <eos> being in the heart of times square also means it sits in the heart of one of the year 's biggest celebrations every new year 's eve when an estimated one million people pack into times square to ring in the new year . <eos> in order to increase security and prevent damage to the recruiting station , which sits in the middle of the sea of revelers , the corps of engineers installs temporary metal panels over the front entrance and lower windows each year before the big party . <eos> the panels are then removed after the celebration , often as soon as the morning of new year 's day - which was the case this year , 2011 . <eos> ( photos by chris gardner , new york district public affairs , taken on 12-30-10 and 1-1-11 )

every year our friends the storrs and brays invite a group of families over for a traditional , down-home , southern new year 's dinner . <eos> they feed a lot of people . <eos> 104 this year ! <eos> about 60 are kids ! <eos> so what 's the traditional , down-home , southern new years fare ? <eos> for most of us , it 's food that we do n't have every day . <eos> < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/beardenb/83919656/ '' > black-eyed peas < /a > and < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/beardenb/83919565/ '' > collard greens < /a > are core and symbolize prosperity ( black-eyed peas=change , collard greens=bills or & quot ; green money & quot ; ) . <eos> the brays also serve < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/beardenb/83913088 '' > hog jowl < /a > which brings good luck . <eos> now i 'm sure there are southerners that would debate the significance of each of these foods , whether straight black-eyed peas or hoppin john , hog jowl , pulled pork or ham , etc . <eos> but hey , for all of us who know the storrs/bray cooking , this is the definitive southern new year 's meal ! <eos> the new year would n't be right without it ! <eos> thanks to the storrs and brays for doing this . <eos> these photos are a small < i > thank you < /i > for having all of us into your home . <eos> i hope the photos do justice to your great food . <eos> -- b

a legend supposed to explain the origin of this pilgrimage has given rise to controversies between critical and traditional schools , especially in recent times . <eos> a vehicle by which the legend was disseminated and pilgrims drawn to the site was the miracles of our lady of rocamadour , written ca . <eos> 1172 , an example of the miracula , or books of collected miracles , which had such a wide audience in the middle ages . <eos> according to the founding legend , rocamadour is named after the founder of the ancient sanctuary , saint amator , identified with the biblical zacheus , the tax collector of jericho mentioned in luke 19:1-10 , and the husband of st. veronica , who wiped jesus ' face on the way to calvary . <eos> driven out of palestine by persecution , st. amadour and veronica embarked in a frail skiff and , guided by an angel , landed on the coast of aquitaine , where they met bishop st. martial , another disciple of christ who was preaching the gospel in the south-west of gaul . <eos> after journeying to rome , where he witnessed the martyrdoms of st. peter and st. paul , amadour , having returned to france , on the death of his spouse , withdrew to a wild spot in quercy where he built a chapel in honour of the blessed virgin , near which he died a little later . <eos> this account , like most other similar legends , does not make its first appearance till long after the age in which the chief actors are deemed to have lived . <eos> the name of amadour occurs in no document previous to the compilation of his acts , which on careful examination and on an application of the rules of the cursus to the text can not be judged older than the 12th century . <eos> it is now well established that saint martial , amadour 's contemporary in the legend , lived in the 3rd not the 1st century , and rome has never included him among the members of the apostolic college . <eos> the mention , therefore , of st. martial in the acts of st. amadour would alone suffice , even if other proof were wanting , to prove them doubtful . <eos> the untrustworthiness of the legend has led some recent authors to suggest that amadour was an unknown hermit or possibly st. amator , bishop of auxerre , but this is mere hypothesis , without any historical basis . <eos> the origin of the sanctuary of rocamadour , lost in antiquity , is thus set down along with fabulous traditions which can not bear up to sound criticism . <eos> after the religious manifestations of the middle ages , rocamadour , as a result of war and the french revolution , had become almost deserted . <eos> in the mid-nineteenth century , owing to the zeal and activity of the bishops of cahors , it seems to have revived , and pilgrims and tourists are beginning to crowd there again .

sandbagging major focus of day 2 flood operations governor , adjutant general meet with leaders , guardsmen fargo , n.d. ¡ª day 2 of flood operations came in overcast and cold in north dakota , but the faces of those fighting the flood remain bright and warm . <eos> already , 300-plus guardsmen on state active duty are working side-by-side with community members to hold back the rising red river , which fills the border between north dakota and minnesota . <eos> their looks are filled with resolve as they fill and place sandbags and help with traffic control as trucks haul mud from borrow pits for dike construction . <eos> after an 8 a.m. meeting followed by a press conference at fargo ¡¯ s city hall , north dakota gov . <eos> john hoeven and maj. gen. david sprynczynatyk , north dakota adjutant general , headed toward river drive south in fargo , where a slew of fargo south high school students were busy sandbagging . <eos> north dakota airmen from the 119th wing were woven in between the students in sandbag lines that extended from pallets on the street and in driveways , through garages and out back doors . <eos> the quickly rising river behind them reminded them of the urgency of their mission . <eos> the biggest immediate threat lies in fargo , where the river is expected to crest between 37 and 39 feet by the weekend . <eos> major flood stage is 30 feet . <eos> ¡° our three primary missions today include traffic control ¡­ ensuring that people coming into this area have the authorization to do so . <eos> in addition , we ¡¯ re doing resource control checkpoints all around the community ... and then the major part of the operation today and in the coming days is placing the sandbags , working side-by-side with community members , ensuring there ¡¯ s enough efforts to protect lives and property here in the city of fargo and throughout all of eastern north dakota , ¡± sprynczynatyk said . <eos> the resource control points are places where the city prepositioned sandbags and supplies needed by those fighting the flood . <eos> hoeven stopped to talk to and throw sandbags with those hard at work , and he had a message strictly for guard members on flood operations . <eos> ¡° for all of us , for our citizens in fargo and cass county , throughout the entire state of north dakota , knowing that you ¡¯ re there , our men and women in uniform , helping us out , making sure that whatever needs to be done gets done , thank you , ¡± hoeven said . <eos> homeowners on river drive had similar expressions . <eos> ¡° i just love seeing the guard here ! <eos> it ¡¯ s like the cavalry rolling in to save us , ¡± said a resident in the 3900 block . <eos> others expressed their thanks and offered coffee , water and hot apple cider to the sandbaggers . <eos> despite the 38-degree temperature with a cool wind , everyone remained optimistic . <eos> ¡° it ¡¯ s not too bad of a day out here , so it ¡¯ s alright , ¡± said senior airman greg byer of the 119th wing . <eos> ¡° it ¡¯ s nice to be able to help the community and show them what the guard can do. ¡± byer was manning one of the resource control points on river drive . <eos> he started his 12-hour shift at 7:30 a.m. he volunteered for the duty , and was glad his employer remained supportive this year , as they had last year . <eos> when he ¡¯ s not serving with the guard , byer provides technical support at microsoft in fargo . <eos> what did he think of the adjutant general ¡¯ s visit to his outpost ? <eos> ¡° it ¡¯ s kind of nice to know that he ¡¯ d come out to see what we ¡¯ re doing , check on me , ¡± byer said . <eos> sprynczynatyk was pleased with what he found . <eos> ¡° as i walk about and talk to our soldiers and airmen , i sense the pride in each and every one of them , ¡± he said . <eos> while the main focus of guard efforts in fargo today remains sandbagging , the mission is expected to grow tomorrow to incorporate building hesco barriers to hold back the rising floodwaters . <eos> on thursday , the guard anticipates staging quick reaction forces , or qrfs , that will use various engineer equipment to respond where needed . <eos> while the guard ¡¯ s largest effort is in fargo , guardsmen also are working in ransom and richland counties , are starting duty in jamestown and are closely monitoring the situation in other communities where flooding appears imminent . <eos> ¡ª¡ª since the 2001 terrorist attacks on america , the north dakota national guard has mobilized more than 3,500 soldiers and more than 1,800 airmen in support of the global war on terrorism . <eos> currently , about 800 north dakota guardsmen are serving overseas . <eos> with a total force of about 4,400 soldiers and airmen , sufficient forces remain in the state for emergency response and homeland defense .

archeologists working for wsdot excavated several trenches west of first avenue s. where a neighborhood stood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . <eos> the excavations were mitigation for the effects the s. holgate street to s. king street project will have on the archaeological site . <eos> this small neighborhood was abandoned around 1905 , when it was filled with dirt and turned into a rail yard . <eos> however , pieces of the area ¡¯ s history remain , such as building foundations and discarded household materials like shoes , bottles and glasses . <eos> we plan to store the items at the university of washington ¡¯ s burke museum . <eos> by recovering the items in advance of construction , we are ensuring that the archaeological record will not be effected by our construction activities . <eos> we will also have an extensive monitoring program in place during construction to ensure that construction crews do not inadvertently discover or adversely affect any cultural resources . <eos> learn more about the project at < a href= '' http : //www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/sr99/holgatetoking '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/sr99/holgatetoking < /a > .

each year our church home group celebrates a passover meal on maundy thursday .
three days soaking in a begrudging sun and the beautiful solitude of rosie 's room . <eos> best friends and trunkers and more parky and co. and then there 's that church . <eos> a spectacular thing , easter , a spectacular trip to boston and back . <eos> soak it up .
family passover celebration ( as photographed by the resident presbyterian )
the college chapel was built in late perpendicular style between 1629 and 1631 by bishop williams of lincoln . <eos> its chief glories were the windows and the screen ; this is built of cedar wood ( to recall the temple in jerusalem ) and for over a hundred years filled the chapel with the scent of cedar . <eos> the front pews with their statues and the carved ceiling were added in the 1680s . <eos> since then the chapel has remained almost unchanged . <eos> the windows are the masterpiece of abraham van linge , 1629-31. he was the finest glass painter of his generation . <eos> they are not stained glass , but enamelled : the enamel was painted on then fired ; the heat and length of firing determined the final colour . <eos> it is a tricky , sophisticated technique of which van linge was the supreme master . <eos> the panels in the east window are 'typologically ' arranged : on the top , six scenes from the life of jesus ; underneath them , six corresponding scenes from the old testament . <eos> all the links except for the last are explicitly drawn in the scripture .

as part of our training at the < a href= '' http : //www.exploratorium.edu '' rel= '' nofollow '' > exploratorium < /a > , we read an excerpt from a book called < a href= '' http : //www.amazon.com/botany-desire-plants-eye-view-world/dp/0375760393/sr=8-1/qid=1163267227/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5975505-4035322 ? ie=utf8 & amp ; s=books '' target= '' _new '' rel= '' nofollow '' > botany of desire < /a > , by michael pollan . <eos> in it , we learned that the apples that grow from seeds are not edible , and the ones we buy in the supermarket are from grafted trees , clones of apples selected hundreds of years ago as being delicious . <eos> this was in the context of the myth of johnny appleseed , aka john chapman . <eos> since he was planting apples from seeds , turns out that he was n't really bringing the gift of < i > apples < /i > per se , but rather the gift of < i > apple cider < /i > ! <eos> that 's what apples used to be for , not for eating . <eos> in fact , that whole & quot ; one apple a day keeps the doctor away & quot ; adage was a publicity move on the apple industry part to reboot the image of apples from a & quot ; devil 's fruit & quot ; to a healthy option . <eos> in any case , what we explainers latched on right away was the fact that you make < i > hard cider < /i > out of apples , and promptly decided to make our own . <eos> so , < b > ye olde cidey cider clubbe shoppe < /b > was born , and we had a cider-making party . <eos> this is photographic evidence of said endeavour . <eos> enjoy !

five hour loop hike up helderberg , with views 360 degree views of the cape town region .
the bus was much older . <eos> they filled the under-bus storage and back half of the bus with cartons , so i had to have my bag with me on my seat . <eos> i was there early and was able to sit directly behind the driver . <eos> halfway to harbin we made an unscheduled stop to unload the boxes and then later made another stop to pick someone up . <eos> with all of this we were over an hour late arriving in harbin and the sun set as i arrived .

the campus planning office has designed a new garden at the south end of the famous stanford quadrangle . <eos> the expansive main quad contains the university 's first buildings , constructed between 1887 and 1891. with its palm trees and sandstone arcades , the distinctively northern california style of the inner quad has a calming influence on passersby , and students frequently can be found studying in the shadows of its arches , or sleeping on the edges of its sun-drenched planter islands . <eos> the stanford campus plan was designed by famed landscape architect frederick law olmsted , who designed new york 's central park . <eos> the university 's & quot ; mission-style & quot ; architecture was strongly influenced by the romanesque designs of h.h . <eos> richardson . <eos> university architects shepley , rutan and coolidge of boston were young associates of the famous architect . <eos> departments and programs fortunate enough to have offices in the quad include cultural and social anthropology , urban studies , classics and asian languages .

my favourite place in london - i first went about 20 years ago . <eos> sadly it 's closing down in a couple of weeks and relocating to lincolnshire , so i made sure to get down there and get a few macro shots of the butterflies before it was too late . <eos> had some trouble with the lens steaming up at first but i think some of them came out pretty well . <eos> i did n't realise just how shallow the depth of field on my macro lens is until i saw some of these photos - i think next time i 'll try stepping back a little and cropping afterwards !

jesse found a good trail - giant ledge , in the catskills - and we met him and nitya up there for a hike . <eos> it was amazing , a really beautiful trail all made of stones . <eos> at the top of the mountain , it began to snow . <eos> ( magic ! ) <eos> on the way out , our car 's tire went out so we pulled up in front of this place that had this interesting & quot ; life gannon & quot ; sign outside . <eos> ( well , interesting to me - my brother gannon died a few years ago . ) <eos> the tire was pretty stuck , so we had to go hit up these folks for some wd40 , and then , a phone - though our call for help was n't needed , because another passing stranger and jesse managed to knock the rusted bolts loose while we were phoning . <eos> the folks up there were living in a house much like we fantacize about , with a big garden and a lot of rescued cats . <eos> and they were vegan .

< a href= '' http : //www.usaraf.army.mil '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.usaraf.army.mil < /a > burundi peacekeepers prepare for next rotation to somalia by rick scavetta , u.s. army africa bujumbura , burundi ¨C under the shade of a tree , pvt . <eos> avlerie mdayimiye cleans her kalashnikov assault rifle and chats with fellow infantry soldiers about their upcoming peacekeeping deployment to somalia . <eos> one of two women in her battalion , mdayimiye reflects on her decision to join the infantry with pride . <eos> ¡° i want to support my nation and to help other people , ¡± she said . <eos> in the coming months , the infantrywoman will have the opportunity to do both . <eos> recently trained through the u.s. state department-led african contingency operations training and assistance program , mdayimiye ¡¯ s battalion will soon serve with the african union mission in somalia , a peacekeeping operation geared toward stabilizing somalia ¡¯ s security situation . <eos> but now , she is among hundreds of burundian national defense force troops awaiting orders to move to mogadishu , the somali capital , where they will serve a one year tour alongside ugandan troops . <eos> while waiting , the battalion set up camp near the bujumbura international airport . <eos> soldiers dry clothes and bedding under midday sun and cluster under shade to clean their rifles . <eos> a few hundred yards away , a massive ethiopian airways jet touches down on the tarmac . <eos> nearby , air defense artillerymen shout commands as they drill with their 23-mm cannons . <eos> smoke drifts from peat cooking fires between the camp ¡¯ s green camouflage tents , signaling lunch time . <eos> mdayimiye taps a magazine into her rifle , checks that it ¡¯ s functioning properly and heads to a nearby field , where soldiers stir large pots of rice and beans . <eos> meanwhile , at burundi ¡¯ s military headquarters , u.s. army africa officers are discussing peacekeeping operations with senior burundian officers ¨C sharing ideas on how brigade staff plan missions and run a tactical field headquarters , an effort to improve efficiency within burundi ¡¯ s peacekeeping contingent . <eos> burundi regularly supports african stability through military partnerships , with troops recently taking part in three regional exercises . <eos> in sept. 2009 , burundi sent troops to mlima kilimanjaro , an exercise in tanzania , followed by natural fire 10 , a u.s. army africa-led a humanitarian and civic assistance exercise held in uganda during october . <eos> then , in late-november , burundi participated in eastern african standby brigade military exercises in djibouti . <eos> meanwhile , they continue to train and deploy peacekeepers to mogadishu , a mission burundi has supported since 2007. the u.s. state department supports burundi ¡¯ s ongoing efforts to partner with other african nations in peacekeeping , to include offering assistance through the acota program . <eos> u.s. army africa coordinated its recent mentorship engagement with the u.s. embassy in bujumbura . <eos> participating in peacekeeping is very important for burundi , a nation that experienced 15 years of war within its borders , said brig . <eos> gen. cyprien ndikuryio , who currently heads burundi ¡¯ s land forces and is slated to serve in a senior leadership role with amisom in somalia . <eos> ¡° today our country is peaceful , ¡± ndikuryio said . <eos> ¡® we were helped by the african union and the international community . <eos> supporting peacekeeping efforts shows we are now able to help others through the au and offer experiences we learned. ¡± for nearly two decades , somalia endured war and chaos . <eos> following a 2007 peace deal , some stability was established as moderate islamists joined the somali government . <eos> still , mogadishu remains violent , with extremists and criminal groups working against international efforts to bring security to somali people . <eos> hardliners have made their intent clear , targeting peacekeepers from burundi and uganda . <eos> ¡° one of the main challenges our forces are facing is the use of ieds by al-shabaab insurgents , ¡± ndikuryio said . <eos> in february 2009 , 11 troops from burundi died when insurgents attacked an african union peacekeeping base in somalia 's capital . <eos> another 15 peacekeepers sustained serious injuries . <eos> the islamist group al-shabaab claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing . <eos> then in sept. 2009 , extremists struck again with a suicide bombing at mogadishu airport that left at least nine african peacekeepers dead , to include burundian maj. gen. juvenal niyoyunguruza , deputy commander of the amisom force . <eos> ¡° most of our soldiers who have been killed were killed by ieds , ¡± ndikuryio said . <eos> ¡° we are not experienced with managing that kind of threat , so we look to our international partners , such as u.s. army africa , for information to better prepare ourselves. ¡± cleared for public release . <eos> photos by rick scavetta , u.s. army africa to learn more about u.s. army africa visit our official website at < a href= '' http :

secretary clinton 's remarks with chilean president michelle bachelet , and secretary clinton 's remarks with chilean president-elect sebasti¨¢n piera at santiago 's airport , march 2 , 2010. hillary rodham clinton secretary of state santiago airport santiago , chile march 2 , 2010 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- president bachelet : ( via interpreter ) good morning , everyone . <eos> i would like to , first and foremost , thank the international solidarity of the many neighboring and friend countries , and very particularly i ¡¯ d like to thank the solidarity of the united states , of president obama , and of secretary clinton . <eos> she called me ( inaudible ) very close moment , not only called me but she has come in person to express that solidarity . <eos> at the meeting with the secretary of state , we have discussed several specific subjects . <eos> we talked about the priorities identified by my government , and that we have conveyed to all of our embassies , governments , and international agencies . <eos> our objective is that cooperation will exactly meet and respond to our needs , our most urgent needs . <eos> and as i have pointed out already , these are satellite phones and we have already received yesterday and there is ¨C there are others about to come . <eos> also , temporary ( inaudible ) there have been announced and a field hospital with ( inaudible ) capability . <eos> also , donations in money are very useful , very important , because we need to buy food and medication . <eos> we have also requested power generators , desalination water treatment plants to purify water , saline water . <eos> and as to ( inaudible ) , we need autonomous dialysis systems because dialysis , as you know , calls for pure water , and in those impacted areas there is no water . <eos> there are other elements indeed that we have discussed with the secretary , but mainly what we need is semi-temporary or temporary semi-permanent hospital facilities , as many , many have been destroyed . <eos> and we need to have them and they are ¨C they will be arriving soon . <eos> the government knows that people need water , food , and don ¡¯ t think that ¨C we do have them in our country , but how can we supply them if we don ¡¯ t have bridges or roads ? <eos> and we need to have authorities communicated with the people to know exactly what their needs are and get to them immediately . <eos> and that is why we have ¨C i know that it ¡¯ s important for the hospitals for them to care for the wounded and for all the victims . <eos> for that we have sought the support of the international community . <eos> we are already , of course , distributing all these elements . <eos> we do have here in the back , planes with contingents and with food . <eos> but that ¨C we need to do it very fast , get to the remotest corners of the country and get there soon . <eos> president bachelet : thank you very much , madam secretary of state . <eos> president bachelet : ( via interpreter ) finally , i ¡¯ d like to thank very particularly secretary clinton , president obama , for the great support and friendship that they have given us and that the chilean people will be eternally grateful . <eos> thank you . <eos> secretary clinton : president bachelet , i first come with the great sympathy and support from president obama and the people of the united states . <eos> this devastating earthquake has wrought so much damage across your country . <eos> the ferocity was 800 times greater than the earthquake that hit haiti , and your leadership and the extraordinary efforts of your government and the people of chile are responding with resilience and strength . <eos> and the united states is ready to respond to the request that the government of chile has made so that we can provide not only solidarity , but specific supplies that are needed to help you recover from the earthquake . <eos> i was planning to be in chile today anyway for a long-scheduled trip and i was so looking forward to meeting with president bachelet who is a leader whom i admire greatly and consider a friend . <eos> and when i spoke with the president , i said , ¡° i will not come if it will interfere in any way. ¡± and we changed the itinerary so that i could come and i brought with me 25 of these satellite phones . <eos> we have identified 62 as the highest priority for the government ¡¯ s request . <eos> i had 25 on my plane loaded on and i ¡¯ m going to give this one to you , madam president . <eos> and let me just add after consulting with the president and her ministers , we are sending eight water purification units . <eos> they are on their way . <eos> we have identified a mobile field hospital unit with surgical capabilities that is ready to go . <eos> we are working to fill the need for autonomous dialysis machines . <eos> we are ready to purchase and send electricity generators , medical supplies and are working to identify and send portable bridges so that some of the places that are remote that lost their bridges will be able to be reconnected to the country . <eos> people are working . <eos> that ¡¯ s a good sound . <eos> and finally , madam president , after discussing the needs that chile has , we will look to see if we can provide additional equipments from portable kitchens to helicopters to assist you in this massive rescue recovery effort that you are undertaking . <eos> and additionally , we will let the people of america , who are very anxious to help chileans , know that they can contribute to the chilean red cross ; that they can contribute to the caritas chile and the onemi programs . <eos> we will get that information and give our press the specifics . <eos> question : hello , madam president . <eos> i ¡¯ m over ¨C president bachelet : where are you ? <eos> oh , yes . <eos> question : madam president , you ¡¯ ve described some of the things you need , but can you give us an idea of the scale ; maybe billions of dollars or less that you need for ¨C president bachelet : forgive me , i didn ¡¯ t hear the last part of your ¨C question : yes , what is the scale ¨C president bachelet : we can ¡¯ t hear you . <eos> secretary clinton : nearer . <eos> closer . <eos> go right up there , yeah . <eos> question : what scale of things do you need ? <eos> what dollar amount ? <eos> could it be in the billions of dollars ? <eos> and what specifically can the u.s. do ? <eos> can it use ¨C can it send some of the military over ( inaudible ) using the diplomats in europe to get aid from them ? <eos> president bachelet : well , we are going to receive aid and support from many different countries and organizations but i would say we can not give an exact and accurate figure right now on how much it will cost . <eos> i mean , there has been some estimation made . <eos> they talk about 30 thousand million dollars . <eos> but really , i mean , with some places , there ¡¯ s still poor communications . <eos> so we are more focused right now in doing all the emergency , the short-term , i would say , initiatives that people need to assure food , water , electricity , and of course , public order . <eos> but in the meantime , we will start doing the estimation . <eos> we have rough estimations , like we have two million people who have been damaged by the earthquake in different levels of damage . <eos> we have an estimation that at least 500 houses ¨C 500,000 houses have damage . <eos> but we have to ¨C we are now , in the meantime , sending experts : engineers , architects , and so on , to evaluate in the field the kind of damage and if those kinds of public works can be repaired or have to be completely rebuilt . <eos> so until now , we don ¡¯ t have the exact ¨C i could not answer to you the exact ¨C how much it will cost to rebuild , to reconstruct all the damage . <eos> but i can only say it will be a lot , because chile has the capacity , we have the engineers , we have the people , we have the experience , we have people trained and all that , but i think it will take long and it will mean a whole lot of money . <eos> so we have been talking also with the secretary of state of another kinds of initiatives in the financial ¨C i mean , chile today ( inaudible ) creditor , so we think we could be able to have also with the good credit from whatever , world bank or ¨C and we will discuss those issues with the future government so we can advance in that , too . <eos> i do not have the exact figure . <eos> as you know , we have updates every two and three hours , and the secretary of state also offered human resources , that is , experts , engineers , and others . <eos> and ¨C but i will give the floor to her so she can ( inaudible ) . <eos> secretary clinton : i think it ¡¯ s understandable that what the president has said is there needs to be a very good assessment , and it ¡¯ s very difficult to do that assessment while you ¡¯ re still trying to help people get food where they need it , provide medical care , and even reach some of the more remote areas . <eos> and we stand ready to help in any way that the government of chile ¨C and i will say this to the president-elect mr. pinera when i meet with him ¨C any way that the government of chile asks us to . <eos> we are so grateful for what chile did in haiti . <eos> your rescue teams were among the very best in the entire world . <eos> and we want to help chile , who has done so much to help others . <eos> and i can only imagine the extent of the damage ¨C 2 million people , at least , who are displaced . <eos> so we stand ready to offer what we ¡¯ ve asked for now and to stay , as your partner and your friend , for the long term . <eos> we ¡¯ ll be there to be of help when others leave because we are committed to this partnership and friendship with chile . <eos> thank you . <eos> ============ remarks by secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and chilean president-elect sebastian pinera march 2 , 2010 santiago airport santiago , chile secretary clinton : well , thank you very much . <eos> i just had the privilege and opportunity of a long conversation with president-elect pinera about the immediate crisis of the earthquake and about a number of important issues that we will be working on together upon his becoming president next week . <eos> chile and the united states have a very close bilateral relationship . <eos> we have explored a number of the important matters that are on our agendas together , but we also have regional and international responsibilities . <eos> chile is a member of the g-20 . <eos> president-elect pinera will be coming to washington for president obama ¡¯ s nuclear security summit . <eos> there are a number of critical issues that we must work on together . <eos> i reiterated our strong support as chile recovers from the earthquake . <eos> and president-elect pinera mentioned specific needs that chile will have for reconstruction , and we ¡¯ ve offered assistance in that phase as well . <eos> well , the president-elect informed me that chile is not a member of the g-20 , but the g-20 will be working to help chile as long ¨C as well as other international financial institutions . <eos> and certainly with the president-elect ¡¯ s background in business , he will be a very important voice in all of the multilateral discussions about the economy going forward . <eos> president-elect , on behalf of president obama and the people of the united states , we stand with you . <eos> we look forward to working with you , and congratulations upon your inauguration next week . <eos> president-elect pinera : ( via interpreter ) i want to very much thank secretary of state hillary clinton for her visit and also for the willingness that she has indicated to cooperate with chile so that we can not only deal with the current emergency but also work towards the plan for reconstruction that chile needs to carry out with a sense of a unity and solidarity . <eos> the meeting with secretary clinton was a long one . <eos> it was a deep meeting , it was a fertile meeting , and i think that we have covered not only many bilateral issues as well as the issues chile is facing now during the emergency and its phase of reconstruction , but also many multilateral issues of interest to us both . <eos> we share with the united states a number of values ¨C freedom , democracy , respect for human rights , a sense of cooperation ¨C and above all , we share the same ideas with regards to challenges of the 21st century . <eos> and so we posed to her and we represented to her our willingness to continue to cooperate , but even more closely than before , on strengthening democracy , protecting human rights . <eos> we also asked secretary clinton for cooperation from the united states with regard to technology , because if the united states can provide us with very good information on renewable energy , environmentally friendly energy , technology necessary to provide housing ¨C temporary housing , to provide prefabricated housing quickly , this is going to help , particularly in the cases of 500,000 people who have been left without shelter as a result of the earthquake ; also in terms of renovation and also issues of entrepreneurship , because chile is now at a time in its history where it needs to make a leap forward . <eos> our hope for chile is that it will be the first country of latin america to beat underdevelopment , to beat poverty . <eos> and we hope to do so while we strengthen democracy and work towards peace . <eos> and finally , i asked the secretary of state to please extend our invitation to president obama so that he will visit chile in the near future . <eos> and i also assured her of my attendance at the nuclear security summit in washington , d.c. in april . <eos> i also hope that i will have the opportunity to have many more meetings with secretary clinton so that we can further the ties that join our two countries , so that we can work towards the achievement that our people require . <eos> and i want to thank you , secretary , so much for being here today . <eos> i hope that our fertile bilateral relationship leads to many good things for our two nations . <eos> thank you . <eos> secretary clinton : thank you so much . <eos> question : a question , madam secretary . <eos> hi , madam secretary . <eos> i ¡¯ m over here . <eos> secretary clinton : sorry . <eos> oh , there you are . <eos> ( laughter . ) <eos> question : hi , mr. president-elect . <eos> i have a question for you , whether you believe that you ¡¯ re satisfied with the response of the government to the earthquake . <eos> do you believe , for example , that they should have deployed the military within the 24-hour period ? <eos> that could have , perhaps , avoided some of the looting that we ¡¯ re seeing in the most affected areas . <eos> and for the secretary : we know that you like to get out in person and see these situations for yourself . <eos> do you feel a little disappointed that you weren ¡¯ t able to in this case ? <eos> and you also went to haiti after that quake . <eos> can you just to explain to our viewers and readers at home the differences you see and the reaction to the situation ? <eos> thank you . <eos> president-elect pinera : ( via interpreter ) when you go through a catastrophe as massive as the one that chile has suffered , let ¡¯ s remember that this was not just a large earthquake . <eos> it ¡¯ s one of the greatest , most powerful earthquakes that have ever been recorded . <eos> over 75 percent of chile ¡¯ s population was affected by it . <eos> there are basic priorities that need to be dealt with immediately . <eos> those are to maintain public order and safety , to provide the basics needs to the people , such as water , power . <eos> if the armed forces can help in this initiative , they should be used . <eos> they can provide technology and logistics , the staff necessary to get many of these jobs done . <eos> and therefore , i applaud the government of chile for having established a state of catastrophe that made it possible for them to make use of the armed forces in this situation . <eos> my team is currently studying what it is we are going to do when we take office so that possibly we will be extending this state of catastrophe to continue dealing with the situation to provide water as quickly as possible , provide water ¨C sorry , power as quickly as possible , and do this in a way that this emergency phase will come to a close quickly and we can begin with the work of reconstruction . <eos> secretary clinton : i have been visiting sites of disasters for more than 30 years , as a first lady in arkansas , as a first lady of the united states , as a senator from new york , and now as secretary of state . <eos> and it is very clear to me that chile is much better prepared , much quicker to respond , more able to do so . <eos> the leadership that president bachelet and president-elect pinera are providing to make sure that they work together in order to keep the recovery and relief efforts going seamlessly is exactly what one would expect . <eos> there is no doubt in my mind as we stand here at an airport that thankfully is functioning and relief flights are coming in , that chile is prepared , is dealing with this massive disaster and will be on the road to an even better recovery in the future . <eos> question : president-elect pinera , buenos tardes . <eos> we ¡¯ d like to know how you plan to pay for the reconstruction efforts , which are going to be considerable , what you estimate they ¡¯ re going to cost . <eos> and also , how does this affect your economic plan of 6 percent growth and 200,000 jobs created in your first year in office ? <eos> and for madam secretary , we just wanted to ask you whether you think that president-elect ¡¯ s attitude toward venezuela and cuba will be helpful or a hindrance to the relations between the u.s. and those countries , and chile and those countries . <eos> thank you . <eos> interpreter : dos preguntas , primero para el president-electo pinera ¨C sorry . <eos> ( laughter . ) <eos> president-elect , how do you plan to pay for the reconstruction efforts that are going to have to be carried out , and how do you plan to reconcile those with your platform for 6 percent growth for the nation and 200,000 more jobs ? <eos> and for secretary clinton , the question was -- secretary clinton : no , just his answer is sufficient . <eos> interpreter : okay . <eos> the president-elect answered : we are finishing our diagnosis right now , so we ¡¯ re not quite sure of all the figures and absolutely all the details . <eos> what i can tell you this is the most important thing we need to deal with right now . <eos> so far , the count is that there are over 730 people who have died , more or less . <eos> that number may continue to grow , unfortunately , because a number of people are still missing . <eos> we know that there are people who are caught under the rubble . <eos> and so we will continue to work on this . <eos> this is probably the worst and the most ¨C the saddest thing that we ¡¯ re dealing with right now . <eos> we know this effort is going to entail an enormous investment . <eos> figures right now are in the area of $ 30 billion . <eos> we ¡¯ re not sure of that , but that ¡¯ s more or less in the area of 16 percent of this country ¡¯ s gnp . <eos> therefore , an amendment will have to be made to our plan , because we are going to have to factor in one very important element , and that is the phase of reconstruction . <eos> how are we going to carry this out ? <eos> well , luckily , chile ¡¯ s financial situation is extremely solid . <eos> we have fruitful resources ¨C financial resources and human resources that will allow us to do much . <eos> we will also be given a helping hand by the international community , which has already shown its solidarity . <eos> you ¡¯ ve seen it at this very airport . <eos> president lula came to visit us , the secretary of state is here with us today , and the president of peru is going to be visiting us shortly . <eos> this is a demonstration of the efforts at reconstruction that have already begun and that we are already being helped with . <eos> secretary clinton : as to the second question , chile and the united states share common values : a great belief in democracy , a respect for private property and free markets , a commitment to free expression and independent media , and so much else . <eos> and we will stand strongly on behalf of those values in our hemisphere and around the world . <eos> question : ( in spanish . ) <eos> president-elect pinera : ( in spanish . ) <eos> interpreter : the question had to do with ¨C the question was for the president-elect . <eos> what do you think of the decisions of the government ? <eos> do you think that they should ¡¯ ve used more military ? <eos> do you think that greater power should have been exercised in that sense ? <eos> the response is : there has been an enormous wave of vandalism , looting , crime in the cities of concepcion and talcahuano . <eos> this is absolutely unacceptable . <eos> it simply worsens the already catastrophic situation we ¡¯ re in . <eos> i hope that the government will be using all the tools necessary in order to combat crime and to restore order . <eos> if more troops ¨C if more people are needed , they should be used . <eos> fighting crime is a priority of our administration . <eos> and i want to say something with regards to the figures i gave a little while ago . <eos> we will not change the figures we gave for expecting 6 percent in growth and 200,000 additional jobs . <eos> those figures remain . <eos> and perhaps the phase of reconstruction can help to accelerate our growth and increase the number of jobs that we have . <eos> but in any catastrophe , the first things you need to worry about are maintaining public order and providing the basic needs of the people in terms of water , power , et cetera . <eos> this is not the time to evaluate the performance of the government . <eos> this is not the time to cast blame or say that anything has been done wrong . <eos> this is the time to provide solutions , and evaluations can come later . <eos> question : ( in spanish . ) <eos> interpreter : a question for secretary of state clinton : if the government of chile requires it , would the united states be willing to send troops to chile ? <eos> secretary clinton : well , we have said we will offer any help , but that has never been mentioned . <eos> certain equipment has certainly been requested , which we will attempt to provide . <eos> but i have great confidence in chile ¡¯ s ability to manage its security needs . <eos> we want to be helpful where they have gaps , and that ¡¯ s what we will try to fill . <eos> # # # # # # source : u.s. department of state .

i visited the davis bridge battlefield in march 2010. the battle of davis bridge , also known as hatchie 's bridge , was fought on october 5 , 1862. csa major general earl van dorn was attempting to move his army west of the hatchie river , in southwest tennessee , after his defeat at corinth , mississippi . <eos> with very few bridges crossing the hatchie river , van dorn was forced to engage the federal forces under the command of us major generals edward o.c . <eos> ord and stephen a. hurlbut . <eos> the confederate attack would fail miserably and they would be forced back several miles . <eos> van dorn would succeed in finding another crossing point and would move his army to holly springs , mississippi . <eos> the federal army would suffer 500 casualties compared to 400 on the confederate side . <eos> unfortunately , for federal fortunes , the confederate army would escape to fight again . <eos> photos by : michael noirot < a href= '' http : //www.battlefieldportraits.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > www.battlefieldportraits.com/ < /a > < a href= '' http : //thismightyscourge.com/ '' rel= '' nofollow '' > thismightyscourge.com/ < /a >

visiting fussen and neuschwanstein castle was going to be one of the highlights of my trip to bavaria , germany in october 2009. i hit fussen on an absolutely gorgeous day - crystal clear and sunny . <eos> i was looking for some great shots of neuschwanstein after about a week of rain . <eos> from the bus stop you have to hike up a steep hill for a little bit - and unfortunately i started uphill at the same time three busloads of japanese tourists started the climb - so no chance for solitude at all . <eos> the thought of shooting in perfect conditions kept pushing me on - right up to the time that i got to the gate to the marienbrucke trail and found it locked and barred . <eos> i was so depressed - thought about skirting the gate and cutting through the woods but there was a nasty looking guard there . <eos> how depressing ! <eos> i did n't get the shots i wanted , did n't want to hang around with hundreds of yapping tourists , so i ended back to fussen , walked around , and took the bus back to mittenwald determined to come back to fussen when the gate is open . <eos> fussen is a charming little town too - i should have spent more time there .

activists gathered in front of the white house , to stand in & quot ; recession era med-lines & quot ; ( think & quot ; depression-era bread lines & quot ; ) . <eos> why ? <eos> earlier in the week , the white house floated a proposal to freeze all non-military discretionary spending for three years-which could have devastating implications for life-saving programs that provide medicine , doctor 's visits , housing , and other supportive services for people with hiv in the u.s. this comes after statements from the obama administration that global aids programs could be flat-funded for the second year in a row . <eos> we were there to say that if he goes through with the budget freeze , people with aids will be left out in the cold , standing in line , waiting to get access to aids treatment .

cassandra siefert & amp ; david tompkins hood river , or - july 16 , 2005 i was actually asked to be the photographer . <eos> however , since i no longer had a functional film camera ... and was still waiting in the digital slr . <eos> i felt it only fair to offer up the opportunity to jonathan , supplimenting his film slr shots with my simple digitals ... sometimes it 's all about the eye , the opportunity , and flat-out skill that really gets the good stuffs ! <eos> ( plus , as a girl , i was privy to some of the prep moments he could n't have otherwise gotten ! )
